        <p>Royal D. Suttkus joined the Tulane University faculty
        in 1950 and immediately began building the modern fish
        collection on a foundation of just two mounted fish
        specimens left over from the early museum. By 1968 the
        fish collection had grown to a size of just over two
        million specimens, overfilling its space in Richardson
        Memorial and Dinwiddee Halls on the main campus. Cagle's
        dream of developing land on the Mississippi River as an
        Environmental Biology Laboratory was realized in part in
        1968, when, under Suttkus' direction, the fish, bird,
        mammal, and vertebrate fossil collections were moved to
        the F. Edward Hebert Riverside Research Laboratories in
        Belle Chasse, establishing the Systematics and
        Environmental Biology Laboratory, now the <a
        
      href="http://www.tubri.org/museum/">Tulane Museum of
        Natural History.</a></p>
        <p>In 1976, Suttkus convinced the Tulane administration
        to formally recognize the zoological collections at
        Riverside as the Tulane University Museum of Natural
        History, and to appoint him as the Museum's first
        Director. In 1979 the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,
        National Ecology Research Center established a field
        station at Riverside to study vertebrates in the waters
        around the Gulf of the Mexico. The Tulane Fish Collection presently contains over 7 million specimens and is one of the largest fish collections in the world.  Remarkably, Suttkus himself had a hand in collecting over 5 million of the fish specimens during his many expeditions across the southern United States and Central America. </p>
        <p> Suttkus retired from Tulane University in 1990. Over
        a career at Tulane spanning 50 years Suttkus, has
        published over 100 scientific papers, described 32 new species
        of southeastern fishes (20% of all the species
        described from the southeast during that period and 50% of the
        new fishes from Gulf Coast drainages) and directed&nbsp;18
        graduate students (4 M.S., 14 Ph.D.). As Emeritus
        Professor and Curator of the Museum, he continues to
        collect and publish on fishes and other organisms in his retirement.

In October of 2000, friends, colleagues and former students of R.D. Suttkus gathered at the Pontchartrain Hotel in New Orleans to pay tribute to Suttkus’ 50 years of service to Tulane University and the field of biology. The Royal D. Suttkus Jubilee featured a one-day symposium, with tributes and testimonials on Suttkus' professional accomplishments; a banquet, featuring a song by Buck Snelson and a tally of Suttkus' fish collecting; and a dedication ceremony at the Tulane University Museum of Natural History, during which the Tulane fish collection was renamed the Royal D. Suttkus Fish Collection.

<p>
This is the official web site of the Royal D. Suttkus Jubilee.  In it, you will find lists of Jubilee participants, Suttkus Symposium presentations, Suttkus students, Suttkus publications, Suttkus species descriptions, Suttkus patronyms, the infamous Suttkus song and photos of the Jubilee.  Have fun!
