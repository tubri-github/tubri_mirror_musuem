      style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">For the past 15 years, 
      we have been traveling to rivers along the eastern Gulf, lower Atlantic 
      Coast, and upper Midwest, accumulating material from these sparsely 
      represented areas. In the last two years, we have been collecting tissues 
      for molecular systematic analysis.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
      </SPAN>We have accomplished this by teaming with fellow ichthyologists and 
      state fishery biologists, and assisting in large river sampling trips 
      arranged for game fish monitoring or conservation purposes. By 
      participating in these efforts, we have been able to collect tissues and 
      large numbers of museum specimens from different parts of the ranges of 
      most ictiobine species. Colleagues in Canada are presently sending us 
      tissues and photographs of ictiobines from the Great Lakes and Hudson Bay 
      drainages of Ontario, Saskatchewan and Manitoba. We soon hope to network 
      with ichthyologists in Texas and New Mexico (Dean Hendrickson of the Texas 
      Memorial Museum, Kirk Winemiller of Texas A&amp;M University, Gary Garrett 
      of Texas Parks and Wildlife, and Steve Plantania of the Museum of 
      Southwestern Biology) for assistance collecting specimens and tissues of 
      all forms occurring in the southwestern U.S. </SPAN><SPAN 
      style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"></SPAN>	                                                                                                                                                           </p>
      <P><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">We are 
      presently collaborating with Dr. Salvador Contreras Balderas (who trained 
      with PI Suttkus) and Dr. Lourdes Lozano Villano of Universidad Autonoma de 
      Nuevo Leon to study material in the fish collection there and for the 
      collection of specimens and tissues from Northern Mexico.<SPAN 
      style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>In 1999, 2001, and 2002, PI Bart 
      traveled to Mex�co with Dr. John Lyons of the Wisconsin Department of 
      Natural Resources to establish collaborations with ichthyologists in 
      central and southern Mexico.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
      </SPAN>We have established collaborations with Dr. Franciso Garcia de Leon 
      of Universidad Autonoma de Victoria in Ciudad Victoria, Dr. Guillermo 
      Salgado of Universidad Autonoma de Mexico and Sr. Eduardo Soto Galera of 
      Instituto Polit�cnico Nacional in Mexico, DF, and Drs. Edmundo Di�z Pardo 
      and Raul Pineda Lopez of Universidad Autonoma de Quer�taro in 
      Quer�taro.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>We were able to 
      collect specimens and tissue of <I 
      style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Ictiobus labiosus</I> from the R�o 
      P�nuco system, and <I style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">I. bubalus</I> 
      from the R�o San Fernando system in NE Mexico. We obtained tissues form 
      specimens from three populations of <I 
      style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">I. meridionalis </I><SPAN 
      style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic">(</SPAN>R�o Popalo�pan, Coatzocoalcos 
      and Usumacinta). We are requesting no funding from NSF for this work. We 
      have been funding our travel to Mexico with our own resources and with 
      generous field support from our Mexican colleagues. We are presently 
      jointly seeking funding from Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnolog�a 
      (CONACyT) for four additional trips to Mexico over the next two years to 
      obtain additional specimens and tissues from all parts of the ranges of 
      Mexican forms. </SPAN><SPAN 
      style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"></SPAN></P>
      <P><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">Through these 
      means, we hope to obtain all of the specimens and tissues we need to 
      complete this study. We will use preserved museum material to examine 
      patterns of geographic variation in gross morphology and to establish 
      reliable characters for the identification of species at different life 
      stages. Our approach to morphological aspects of the revision will be to 
      first work through material in the Tulane Fish Collection species by 
      species, and then travel to other museums to study types and work up 
      material the Tulane collection is lacking. Ictiobines are large fish that 
      are not easily shipped.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
      </SPAN>Traveling to other collections will give us the opportunity to 
      study specimens on site, and may afford us additional opportunities to 
      collect fresh tissues for molecular sequencing work.<?xml:namespace prefix
