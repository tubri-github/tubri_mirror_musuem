      of subfamily Ictiobinae (Teleostomi: Catostomidae) are large, deep-bodied, 
      long-finned fishes native to large rivers and lakes in eastern North 
      America, inclusive of Mexico.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
      </SPAN>Seven species of ictiobines are currently recognized in the two 
      extant genera, <I style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Carpiodes </I>and <I 
      style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Ictiobus</I>.<SPAN 
      style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The group is poorly studied and is 
      believed to be much more diverse than presently recognized.<SPAN 
      style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Most of the species have wide, 
      highly overlapping distributions, and may show similar (replicated) 
      patterns of speciation.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Most 
      species of ictiobines are readily diagnosable by morphological 
      characters.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>However, as a 
      consequence of the overlapping distributions and human alteration of the 
      large rivers these fishes inhabit, a number of the species are 
      hybridizing, and this may be complicating efforts to understand diversity 
      and evolutionary history of the group. </P>

      style="tab-stops: 0in .5in 1.0in 1.5in 2.0in 2.5in 3.0in 3.5in 4.0in 4.5in 5.0in 5.5in 6.0in">We 
      propose to revise the two extant ictiobine genera to assess morphological 
      and genetic diversity within currently recognized species.<SPAN 
      style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>We will test the hypothesis that 
      current nominal species are complexes of biological/evolutionary 
      species.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>We will formally 
      describe all newly discovered diversity and establish morphological 
      characters and taxonomic keys to aid others in identification of new and 
      existing forms. We will sequence portions of the mitochondrial and nuclear 
      genomes, and use these data to establish phylogenies at the levels of all 
      ictiobines, genera <I style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Carpiodes 
      </I>and <I style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Ictiobus,</I> and species 
      complexes within these genera.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
      </SPAN>We will use molecular techniques that enable us to screen large 
      numbers of individuals to assess population-level genetic variation and 
      cytonuclear disequilibria, identify interspecific hybrids, and individuals 
      that should be sequenced to develop phylogenetic hypotheses.<SPAN 
      style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Lastly, we will use the derived 
      phylogenies to examine speciation and dispersal patterns, and (by 
      comparing our results to those based on studies of small stream fishes) 
      assess differences in patterns and rates of evolution between large and 
      small stream habitats.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN></P>

      project combines expertise in traditional (morphology-based) and modern 
      (molecular) methods of systematics.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
      </SPAN>It involves analysis and synthesis of data from both of these 
      areas.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>It will provide unique 
      insights into the connections between morphological and genetic 
      differentiation in large-river environments.<SPAN 
      style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>As is true for ictiobines, species 
      representing separately evolving lineages typically come together in 
      large-river environments, and populations within species tend to have 
      higher degrees of connectedness than those of small stream species.<SPAN 
      style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>In addition to resolving taxonomic 
      problems in an important group of large-river fishes, this study will 
      increase general understanding of dispersal, speciation and maintenance of 
      reproductive isolating mechanisms in large-river environments.<SPAN 
      style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Students at two stages of 
      professional development (undergraduate and graduate) - including 
      participants in a minority undergraduate research-training program - will 
      receive training in this project</SPAN>. </P>
