            <p>
            The research collection of fishes at TUBRI is the 
            largest collection of post larval fishes in the world, 
            with over 7 million specimens in over 200,000 lots. 
            Recently renamed in honor of Royal D. Suttkus, the collection 
            also features a type room housing 33 holotypes and 38,835 
            paratypes representing 125 species, a separately curated 
            osteological collection with 1352 specimens (271 species in 55 families) 
            of which 638 (150 species, 20 families) are cleared and stained preparations, 
            2010 radiographs representing 21,988 specimens from 284 species and 8 hybrids in 36 families, 
            2428 scale and otolith samples  representing 26 species from 12 families, 
            and 77 sets of branchiostegals of two species of <i>Lepisosteus</i>. 
            </p>
        <div style="float:right; margin:10px;"><img alt="Many types are housed in the collection"
            src="../images/fishImg2.jpg" /></div>
        
        <p>
        The collection is divided among two buildings, one housing 
        jar lots of hagfishes through catfishes and the second housing 
        tank specimens and jar lots of minnows through tetraodontiform fishes.  
        Other facilities include a library featuring ichthyological literature 
        and reprints, alcohol redistillation equipment, and a specimen imaging 
        room for 2-D and 3-D imaging of specimens 
        (see Intelligent Fish Identification System description under Featured Projects) . 
        </p>
        <p>
        The majority of material in the collection is from freshwater river basins in the 
        Gulf-South region (Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Arkansas, Tennessee and Georgia) 
        with diminishing representation northward, north eastward and north westward. The river systems most 
        prominently represented in the collection are, from west to east, 
        Neches, Sabine, Calcasieu, Red, Ouachita, Mississippi, Lake Pontchartrain drainages, Pearl, Pascagoula, 
        small coastal rivers between the Pearl and Pascagoula, Tombigbee, Alabama, and Apalachicola. Colorado River 
        fishes and fishes of other southwestern rivers are well represented. There is extensive representation of 
        Central American (principally Costa Rican) fishes, good representation of the fishes of eastern and central Mexico, 
        and even a few collections of South American fishes. Marine fishes in the collection are mainly from estuaries and 
        inshore waters of the northern Gulf of Mexico. However, the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Coast 
        are moderately represented and there is a scattering of collections from the Pacific Coast of North, 
        Central and South America. There are a few collections from the Indian Ocean off Thailand and Australia, 
        and there is material (fresh and saltwater) coming into the Collection from Indonesia.

        <p>Specimens are contained in Museum-quality, glass jars ranging in size from 4 ounces to 3 liters. 
        The vast majority of the jars are bail-top preserving jars of the highest quality. 
        There are also more than 900 large glass jugs (2-, 3-, and 5-gallon); 160 stainless steel tanks (96 - 36&quot; x 15&quot; x 15&quot; tanks and 64 - 18&quot; x 15&quot; x 15&quot; tanks); 19 wooden tanks (7 - 48&quot; x 20&quot; x 20&quot;, 2 - 60&quot; x 20&quot; x 20&quot;, 7 - 72&quot; x 20&quot; x 20&quot;, and 3 - 96&quot; x 30&quot; x 30&quot;) and 52 plastic tanks (44 1/2&quot; x 39 1/2&quot; x 24&quot;). 
        
       
        All of the jars in the collection have labels of high quality parchment paper or Tyvec polyethylene fiber.  
        All specimens are formalin fixed.  
        Jar lots are preserved in 70% ethanol; tank specimens are preserved in 50% isopropanol.  
        The collection is completely digitized and 95% georeferenced.  
        Records of the collection are accessible on line through <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gbif.org/">GBIF</a> and the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.fishnet2.net/">FishNet2</a> network of fish collection databases, which is presently managed by TUBRI.
