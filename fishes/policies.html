    <h3><a name="mission">Mission:</a><br />Collections in Tulane University Biodiversity Research Institute
    serve as a resource for taxonomic, systematic, ecological and environmental research in the Gulf-South
    region and beyond.</h3>

    <br />
                
    <h3><a name="acquisition">Acquisition and Accession</a> </h3>
    <p>1. Scope of Collections: Tulane University Biodiversity Research Institute comprises collections
    of mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles, fishes, crustaceans, molluscs, vertebrate fossils, fungi
    and plants. Specimens in the collection span a period of approximately 150 years, but the vast
    majority of material was collected in the latter half of the 20th Century. The area of concentration
    of holdings is the Gulf-South region of the United States, with high representation from areas to
    the east and west including Mexico, and diminishing representation northward and southward into
    Central America. Most continents and ocean basins are represented by specimens. </p>
    <p>2. Adequacy of resources: It is the policy of the Tulane University Biodiversity Research Institute a) to maintain adequate space, staff
    and financial resources to properly care for all its collections, b) not to acquire or accession
    material unless adequate space, staff and financial resources are available, and c) to deaccession
    and donate to other institutions possessing adequate space, staff and financial resources, material
    or entire collections if space, staff and financial resources become too limited for its proper
    upkeep. Exceptions to this policy will only be made in emergency situations (such as when national
    plans authorize salvaging of abandoned collections by collections designated as national centers).
    In these cases, acceptance of the material will be temporary, unless or until resources for its
    proper care is forthcoming. </p>
    <p>3. Encumbrances: It is the policy of the Tulane University Biodiversity Research Institute not to accept material with encumbrances, unless
    the encumbrance is within the long-term interest of the institution. Material donated to the Tulane University Biodiversity Research Institute 
    becomes the property of the Tulane University Biodiversity Research Institute and the Tulane University Biodiversity Research Institute reserves the right to accession and house the
    material as it sees fit. It is the Policy of the Tulane University Biodiversity Research Institute to retain all records of prior ownership of
    material. Thus, the Tulane University Biodiversity Research Institute ordinarily accepts terms and conditions for referencing gift material.</p>
    <p>4. Permanent Loan: The Tulane University Biodiversity Research Institute accepts material on &quot;permanent loan&quot;. However, policies
    pertaining to material on permanent loan are no different from those pertaining to other material
    accessioned into the collections. </p>
    <p>5. Special collections: Special collections, such as slides, photographs, and hard parts removed
    from specimens, may be accessioned. The Tulane University Biodiversity Research Institute accepts voucher material from scientific research
    consistent with its mission. </p>
    <p>6. Nonaccessioned collections: Material that is valuable for teaching or future exchange may be
    accepted and maintained temporarily in the Tulane University Biodiversity Research Institute until it can be gifted to others. This material
    typically will not be formally accessioned. </p>
    <p>7. Modes of acquisition: The usual modes of acquisition of material is by research activity,
    expedition, gift, exchange, purchase or bequest. Purchases must be approved by the Tulane University Biodiversity Research Institute Director,
    who is signatory authority on instruments of conveyance involving purchases. </p>
    <p>8. Ethics and Laws: All specimens accessioned into the Tulane University Biodiversity Research Institute must be obtained legally and
    ethically. All local, national and international laws, treaties, regulations, and conventions must
    be observed and documented. The collectors must be able to assure the Tulane University Biodiversity Research Institute that collections were
    made with proper respect to historic sites, natural populations, and natural habitats. Copies of
    collecting permits and other documents establishing legal title to the material, must be provided
    with the material. An unbroken &quot;chain-of-custody&quot;, retraceable back to permits or title
    documents, must accompany all specimens accessioned into the Tulane University Biodiversity Research Institute.</p>
    <p>9. Physical condition: It is the policy of the Tulane University Biodiversity Research Institute to accept only whole, intact specimens that
    are readily identifiable. However, voucher material associated with anatomical or biochemical studies,
    or other studies involving dissections, may be accessioned in special circumstances. Material used in
    doctoral studies, or cited in the literature is presently retained regardless of condition, provided
    the material is suitably preserved.</p>

    <p>10. Data and records: Material accessioned into the
        collection must be accompanied by adequate records as to
        provenance, date of collection, field or laboratory
        preparation, and documentation of title/permits.. Clear
        descriptions of collection locations are acceptable, but
        more precise fixes such as latitude and longitude are
        preferred. Records may be provided in electronic format. </p>
        <p>11. Records sharing: Copies of all records pertaining
        to material accessioned into the Tulane University Biodiversity Research Institute will be provided
        to all individuals and institutions involved in
        collecting the material. </p>
        <p>12. Appraisals: Tulane University Biodiversity Research Institute staff are forbidden from
        providing estimates of the value of material to be
        donated or accessioned. </p>
        <p>13. Complementarity: The focus of collections in the
        Tulane University Biodiversity Research Institute is the Gulf South region of the United States.
        Curators of collections are expected to keep this focus
        and the Tulane University Biodiversity Research Institute's complementarity with other collections
        in mind when considering material for accession. Material
        from other regions of the U.S. and other parts of the
        world is accepted mainly for comparative purposes. </p>
        <p>14. Violations of policy: If it is determined that
        material is acquired in violation of policy, especially
        legal and ethic aspects, the material is to be returned
        to it's legal owner or the appropriate governmental
        authority. Authority for this action rests with Curators-in-Charge
        of the various collections and or the Director. </p>
        <p>15. Authorizations: Acquisitions involving areas
        outside of the Tulane University Biodiversity Research Institute's focus area, or those requiring
        special maintenance or security, must be approved by the
        Director. </p>

        <p>16. Handling of endangered species: The Tulane University Biodiversity Research Institute is
        registered with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,
        Office of Management Authority (permit no. 739958) and is
        in compliance with stipulations of the Endangered Species
        Act and the Convention on International Trade in
        Endangered Species (CITES) regarding interstate and
        foreign transport of museum specimens for non-commercial
        loan, donation or exchange. Specimens of rare, endangered
        and threatened species in the collection are handled in
        similar ways to type material with similar provisions for
        storage, loans and acquisition. </p>

        <h3><a name="managecare">Management and Care of Collections</a></h3> 
        Tulane University Biodiversity Research Institute has
        adopted the Society for the Preservation of Natural
        History Collections' <em>Guidelines for the Care of
        Natural History Collections (Collection Forum 10(1):32-40)</em>
        as its general rules for collection care and management.
        This policy statement outlines other general rules and
        requirements that apply to all collections. In addition,
        individual collections have policies for care and
        management based on the nature of the collections and the
        attending conservation requirements. These policies are
        based on guidelines developed within the various
        collection communities and usually available in published
        form through professional societies. Guidelines for the
        various collections have also been adopted as general
        rules for care and management in collections where they
        are available. </h3>

        <p>A basic premise of collection care, and the policy of
        the Tulane University Biodiversity Research Institute, is that a collection will have a curator in
        place who is trained in caring for, and managing
        activities of the collection. The Curator-in-Charge of a
        collection may be a person with a half-time, adjunct or
        emeritus status. In cases where collections have adjunct
        curators, or collections are temporarily without curators,
        the Director and one or more of the permanent staff will
        serve as advocates for the collections. Advocates are
        expected to apprise themselves of the kinds of care
        required for each collection involved and to administer
        that care as needed to conserve the collections. </p>
        <p>It is the policy of the Tulane University Biodiversity Research Institute to engage in preventive
        conservation, to minimize deterioration of specimens and
        other supporting objects. In its most general form, this
        policy involves maintenance of constant temperature and
        humidity in Tulane University Biodiversity Research Institute buildings, control of exposure of
        specimens to light, and integrated pest management. Other
        details of preventive conservation vary with individual
        collections and are the responsibility of the Curators-in-Charge.
        Oversight for this policy rests with the Director.
        Compliance with this policy will be measured with
        metering devices (temperature/humidity fluctuations) and
        semiannual inspections of collections. </p>

        <p ><a href="#top">Return to Contents</a></p>

        <h3><a name="onsite">Access and On-Site Use</a></h3>
        <h4>1. Authority: Authority for granting access to collections
        rests with the Curator-in-Charge, who is charged with the
        responsibility of balancing the needs of use with the
        needs of conservation. </h4>
        <p>2. Criteria: Users of collections are required to
        provide a written request explaining what is needed, and
        how and for what purpose material in the collection is to
        be used. This information will be used to document the
        value of the collection to society. Users are required to
        demonstrate competence in the handling of specimens and
        willingness to comply with security precautions or other
        restrictions. </p>

        <p>3. Categories of use: Five categories of users are
        recognized based on the kinds of uses of material
        permitted and the amount of supervision required: a)
        professional scientists at properly equipped institutions;
        b) students and scientists not tied to institutions; c)
        educators; d) commercial users or users that require
        extraordinary assistance from collection staff (fees may
        be charged to this category of users); e) the general
        public. In general, professional scientists at research
        institutions are granted the greatest range of uses of
        material and require the least amount of supervision,
        whereas members of the general public have the narrowest
        range and require the greatest supervision. </p>
        <p>4. Exclusive use: Material in the collection may be
        held out for periods of up to five (5) years for the
        exclusive use of researchers affiliated with the
        collection. These periods may be extended beyond this
        time period if progress in completing the investigation
        is satisfactory and other requests for use of the
        material are not pending. </p>
        <p>5. Security: Visitors to the Tulane University Biodiversity Research Institute have to abide by
        its security provisions when using collections.
        Collections in the Tulane University Biodiversity Research Institute are spread over three buildings,
        each with a separate alarm system. The official policy on
        use is that all work in the collections is to be
        performed during normal business hours. However,
        recognizing that out-of-state and international visitors
        often come to the Tulane University Biodiversity Research Institute with the intention of spending
        long hours working in the collections to minimize the
        length of their stay, it is left to individual curators
        to decide whether work is be permitted after hours or on
        weekends, whether supervision is required, and whether
        visitors are to be assigned keys and security codes. This
        courtesy will only be extended only to professional
        scientists on limited visits to the Tulane University Biodiversity Research Institute. </p>
        <p>6. Procedures: Guidelines for handling specimens will
        be established by curators in the various collections and
        submitted to the Director for approval. </p>
        <p>7. Access to records: Access to all records of the
        collection (catalog, field notes, etc.) by users is
        controlled by the Curator-in-Charge. Access to records is
        subject to the same restrictions as access to specimens,
        with professional users having the most access, and
        general public access being the most limited. </p>
        <p>8. Credits: All users of material in the Tulane University Biodiversity Research Institute are
        required to acknowledge such in all resulting
        publications and databases, and to provide the Tulane University Biodiversity Research Institute (through
        the collection involved) with copies of this
        documentation. </p>

        <p>9. Reproductions: The Tulane University Biodiversity Research Institute and it's specimens are
        to be acknowledged for all reproductions of 
        material (photographs, illustrations). Fees may be
        charged for reproductions by commercial users.
        Photographers of specimens must show proof of knowledge
        of specimen preservation. </p>
        <p>10. Evaluation of requests: Requests for use of
        specimens will be evaluated by curators of the various
        collections, in whose hands decisions on use rest. All
        requests (public or professional) must be made through
        the curator of the collection involved. In cases of
        collections without curators, requests should be made to
        the Director, who may seek the advice of experts before
        granting the request. </p>

        <h3><a name="loans">Loans</a></h3>
        <h3>Loans are uses of specimens
        outside the usual confines of the collections which
        normally house them. Thus, the term &quot;loan&quot;

        applies to transfers of specimens to individuals in other
        collections within the Tulane University Biodiversity Research Institute, as well as transfer to
        individuals outside of the Tulane University Biodiversity Research Institute. The loan recipient has
        a custodial responsibility to maintain the specimens as
        if they were in their home collection. </h3>
        <h4><a name="loansin"><em>Incoming loans</em></a> 1.
        Authority: Loans may be requested by curators of
        collections, scientists with research appointments, and
        staff working under the direction of a curator. </h4>
        <p>2. Laws and Ethics: Members of Tulane University Biodiversity Research Institute staff borrowing
        material from other institutions/collections must observe
        all legal and ethical standards pertaining to use of that
        material. </p>
        <p>3. Care and handling: Members of Tulane University Biodiversity Research Institute staff
        borrowing material must observe all guidelines for care
        and handling of borrowed material issued by the loaning
        institution. </p>
        <p>4. Alterations: Members of Tulane University Biodiversity Research Institute staff borrowing
        material must abide by restrictions on ways borrowed
        material may be altered, minimizing alteration where
        possible. They must inform the loaning collection in
        advance of any destructive sampling. </p>

        <p>5. Records: Collections receiving loan material must
        keep records of all incoming loans, and loan transactions.
        </p>
        <h4><a name="loansout"><em>Outgoing loans</em></a> Outgoing
        loans are authorized by a standard agreement that sets
        forth an itemization of the material loaned, the duration
        and conditions of the loan, responsibilities of the
        parties involved, and options for renewal. </h4>
        <p>1. Borrowers: Four categories of borrowers are
        recognized based on experience and facilities for housing
        and working with specimens: a) professional scientists at
        properly equipped institutions; b) students and junior
        scientists not tied to institutions; c) educators; and d)
        commercial users (fees may be charged to this category of
        users) and the general public. In general, professional
        scientists at research institutions are granted the
        greatest access to loans, whereas access to commercial
        users and the general public is most restricted. Loans to
        students must be countersigned by their academic advisor.
        Researchers without permanent institutional affiliations
        must have associate appointments with museums or be
        sponsored by individuals with permanent institutional
        affiliations. </p>
        <p>2. Purposes: Ordinarily, loans are made for scientific,
        educational, and non-commercial purposes. </p>
        <p>3. Institutional responsibility: Borrowers must
        indicate where and under what conditions material will be
        housed. Borrowers will be held accountable for the
        material through their institution. Loans may not be
        transferred from one institution to another, or from one
        researcher to another, without proper notification and
        transfer of invoices. </p>

        <p>4. Records: Individuals interesting in borrowing
        material must submit a written request to the Curator-in-charge
        of the collection involved. The borrowers must specify
        how the material is to be used and whether destructive
        sampling will be involved. Loans will be tracked with
        forms (invoices) that itemize material borrowed and
        specify terms of the loan. Receipt of loans and condition
        of specimens on receipt must be acknowledged by return of
        a signed copy of the loan invoice. </p>
        <p>5. Care: Loan invoices will contain information on
        preservatives in use, and instructions on the proper care
        of specimens. It is assumed that specimens will be
        provided the same conditions of storage as they receive
        in their home collection. Any changes in the original
        plan of study involving use of the specimens, especially
        destructive sampling, must be communicated and approved
        in advance. </p>
        <p>6. Restrictions: All material except primary types,
        exclusive-use material, and extremely rare specimens is
        available for loan. Secondary types may be borrowed under
        special circumstances. Loans of secondary types are
        permitted if specimens are hand carried and returned by
        hand. If holdings of secondary types are large (lot-based
        collections), portions of individual lots may be borrowed
        or a limited number of secondary type lots may be loaned
        by special mail carrier. Rarely will all holdings for
        particular taxa be loaned at once. In cases where limited
        material is available for loan, a portion of the material
        may be loaned and the rest retained until the first
        portion is returned. </p>
        <p>7. Duration: Loans are ordinarily made for 6 months or
        less, but may be extended if requested in writing.
        Specimens are to be returned promptly upon completion of
        the study for which the material was borrowed. </p>
        <p>8. Priority of loans: In cases where the same material
        is requested simultaneously by different users, priority
        of loans will be established first by categories of
        borrowers, and by date of request within category. </p>
        <p>9. Costs and insurance: Loans to qualified researchers
        are normally made free of charge. However, borrowers may
        be expected to pay shipping charges in cases of large
        loans, or loans requiring special handling and insurance.
        </p>

        <p>10. Annotations: Borrowers are required to provide
        written annotations as to reidentification of specimens,
        the nature of study (counts, measurements, illustration),
        and any destructive sampling performed. </p>
        <p>11. Credits: All borrowers of material are required to
        acknowledge the Tulane University Biodiversity Research Institute in all resulting publications and
        databases, and to provide the Tulane University Biodiversity Research Institute (through the
        collection involved) with copies of this documentation. </p>
        <p>12. Grounds for denial: Individuals who abuse any of
        the conditions of this policy will lose their borrowing
        privileges. </p>

        <h3><a name="destructive">Destructive sampling</a></h3>
        1. Intent: Destructive sampling is analysis that destroys or
        alters all or a portion of a specimen or object. This
        policy statement establishes guidelines for permitting
        this important form of use of specimens, while minimizing
        unnecessary damage to specimens. The intent of this
        policy is to balance use of specimens in research against
        the need to conserve specimens for future generations.

        <p>2. Framework: This policy is developed within the
        framework of other collections policies, a number of
        which include references to destructive sampling. In
        general, destructive sampling should not be permitted on
        primary types, specimens of very rare, endangered or
        extinct species. Exceptions may be granted only in
        circumstances that have the potential to benefit the
        species involved or other related species. In such cases,
        the sampling should be performed with the utmost
        attention to future specimen quality. </p>
        <p>3. Authority: Authority for approving destructive
        sampling of unrestricted (common, well-represented, non-type)
        material rests with the Curator-in-Charge. In cases
        involving restricted material, the matter will be
        referred to a panel of experts from the collection
        community, who will be asked to consider the total amount
        of material available in collections in rendering a
        decision. </p>
        <p>4. Evaluation: In cases where requests for destructive
        sampling involve limited material, requests will be
        evaluated on the basis of written information provided by
        the researcher. Intended uses must have scientific merit.
        The researcher must demonstrate competence with proposed
        methods. The methods must be the least intrusive for
        achieving the intended result. The researcher must have
        sufficient resources to carry out the method. The
        research will be required to abide by the institution's
        operational standards for processing and documentation.
        Failure to comply with institutional requirements may be
        grounds for denying future requests. </p>
        <p>5. Operational standards: Unused portions of specimens
        shall be returned to the institution unless otherwise
        agreed upon in writing. Methods and extent of sampling
        shall be documented. Resulting analytical data and
        duplicates of tangible products - e.g., SEM photographs,
        histology slides, or (in the case of DNA and biochemical
        sampling) GenBank accession numbers or computer readable
        copies of sequences - shall be deposited in the Tulane University Biodiversity Research Institute to
        become part of the specimen's permanent record. The
        institution shall receive credit for providing samples to
        the researcher in all publications and databases, and
        shall receive copies of all publications and notices of
        databases.. </p>
