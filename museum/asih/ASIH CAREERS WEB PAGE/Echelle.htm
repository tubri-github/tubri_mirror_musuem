      <p><b>How did you first become interested in ichthyology?</b><br>
        I could have gone into the study of about any group because of a general 
        interest in natural history. I got into fishes because of a fellowship 
        opportunity at The University of Oklahoma with Carl Riggs, my advisor 
        for the M.S. degree.</p>
      <p><b>What steps did you have to take to get where you are today?</b><br>
        Starting a year before I finished the Ph.D., I took a vacated position 
        as Research Biologist at the University of Oklahoma Biological Station. 
        My wife (Alice Fitch Echelle) and I then spent six years as a research 
        team at the station with no responsibilities except whatever research 
        we chose to do. At that time, we were not into grantsmanship, and research 
        was funded out of our own pockets. Still, our publication rate was greater 
        than at anytime before or since. Probably because of that, I got a faculty 
        position at Baylor University. We were there six years when I was offered 
        my present position at Oklahoma State University. I was happy at Baylor 
        and would not have applied for the OSU position were it not for Steve 
        Lehtinen, a former M.S. student of mine who was the graduate-student representative 
        on the OSU search committee and had asked me to apply.</p>
      <p><b>What kinds of skills are required for your career? What experiences 
        do you feel prepared you best for your job?</b><br>
        <b>Required skills:</b> Staying abreast of methods and approaches in data 
        gathering and analysis is a continuing challenge.</p>
      <p><b>Experiences:</b><br>
        1. Summers at the OU Biological Station where, as a graduate student, 
        I was exposed to field biologists of all stripes<br>
        2. Herpetological fieldwork in 1970-71 with Alice and her father (Henry 
        S. Fitch) in Mexico and Central America. This was my first exposure to 
        fieldwork far-removed from home base.<br>
        3. A 2-month stay in 1972 at the Savannah River Ecology Laboratory where 
        I worked with Michael H. Smith learning to use protein electrophoresis 
        for studies in population genetics. This set the course of most of my 
        research career.</p>
      <p><b>What are your responsibilities?</b><br>
        1. Teaching (Evolution; Biology of Fishes, Amphibians, and Reptiles)<br>
        2. Advising graduate students<br>
        3. Maintaining extracurricular support for research<br>
        4. Curating the fish collection in the Oklahoma State University Collection 
        of Vertebrates</p>
      <p><b>What do you like best about your career?</b><br>
        1. The high degree of freedom to pursue academic interests relatively 
        unencumbered by what others think I should be doing.<br>
        2. The opportunity to travel and muck around in the field under the guise 
        of &quot;all in a day's work.&quot;</p>
      <p><b>What would be your most important piece of advice for someone considering 
        the career you're in now? </b><br>
        Become an expert in natural history. Knowledge of natural history breeds 
        questions. </p>
