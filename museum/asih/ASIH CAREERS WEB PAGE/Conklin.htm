        <b>How did you first become interested in ichthyology?</b><br>
        I started keeping aquarium fish when I was about eight years old and had 
        parents that let me have as many aquariums as my allowance allowed. I 
        was also fortunate to grow up near the coast where snorkeling and fishing 
        activities provided me with opportunities to observe fish in their neural 
        habitats. </p>
      <p><b>What steps did you have to take to get where you are today?</b><br>
        A keen interest made for a lot of self-training during my childhood. Much 
        of the literature available to aquarium hobbyists has been derived from 
        scientific studies and that became useful later on. A biology degree, 
        although in botany, contributed a great deal to polishing that training. 
        After graduating from USF I completed an internship and contributed many 
        hours of volunteer service at The Florida Aquarium. </p>
      <p><b>What kinds of skills are required for your career? </b><br>
        Aquarium husbandry skills are probably the most important. These skills 
        are actually an accumulation of knowledge and experience. SCUBA certification 
        and chemistry skills are also useful. </p>
      <p><b>What experiences do you feel prepared you best for your job? </b><br>
        Practical experience with aquarium fish was important however I don't 
        think I would be where I am without the academic training. </p>
      <p><b>What are your responsibilities? </b><br>
        My primary responsibilities involve the quarantine of fish and other aquatic 
        animals and the supervision of water quality control. Secondarily I also 
        participate in the acquisition of specimens from the field and assist 
        in research projects as needed.</p>
      <p><b>What do you like best about your career?</b> <br>
        I enjoy being able to work with aquatic life every day. There is some 
        structure in my daily routine but most days present a different challenge 
        to be solved.</p>
      <p><b>What would be your most important piece of advice for someone considering 
        the career you're in now? </b><br>
        An academic background in natural sciences is important. Obviously the 
        more advanced the degree the better. It seems that the majority of public 
        aquarists have undergraduate degrees while a few have post graduate level 
        degrees. Advanced degrees often occupy management positions but rarely 
        without years of experience. Any practical experience can go a long way 
        in building credentials. Internships and volunteer time at an appropriate 
        institution such as a public aquarium, university lab, or government agency 
        are the most likely sources to get the foot in the door. </p>
