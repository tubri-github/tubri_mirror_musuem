      <p><b>How did you first become interested in ichthyology? </b><br>
        I was always interested in natural history and would likely have become 
        a botanist if Comparative Anatomy hadn't made me love bones. I was a work-study 
        student at Stony Brook and spent 15-20 hours a week working in a lab and 
        interacting with graduate students who were full of advice. A senior honor's 
        project on the taxonomy of two Fundulus species sealed my fate. One of 
        the graduate students, Mary Mickevich, told me if I was interested in 
        systematics, I should get my Ph.D. with Donn Rosen at the American Museum 
        of Natural History who mentored graduate students in a joint program with 
        the City University of New York. I went. </p>
      <p><b>What steps did you have to take to get where you are today? </b><br>
        As above, I listened to the advice of others and then made my own decisions. 
        No one does anything alone, but success in science, especially systematics, 
        depends on developing your own individual style. Several postdoctoral 
        positions, including one at the Natural History Museum in London where 
        I lived for 16 months, gave me a broad, international perspective. I attended 
        my first ASIH meeting in 1977 and haven't missed one since; it was at 
        these and other professional meetings that I first met many of my colleagues. 
        And, it was through my oral presentations that they first learned about 
        my research. </p>
      <p><b>What kinds of skills are required for your career? </b><br>
        What experiences do you feel prepared you best for your job? A critical 
        mind and the ability to communicate your findings to the rest of the world 
        through a variety of media. An artist's eye. Being able to write, sometimes 
        just for the fun of it. International travel and living abroad changed 
        my perspective on the world. A sense of humor.</p>
      <p><b>What are your responsibilities?</b> <br>
        At the moment, research, administration, and public service. I am also 
        an adjunct professor and have mentored a Ph.D. student and several postdocs 
        and undergraduate interns. My research is collection-based and I have 
        collected fishes for the National Fish Collection from throughout the 
        western Pacific and the Caribbean. As the direct supervisor of some 20 
        staff, I am constantly upgrading my skills as a listener, mentor, and 
        problem-solver. I serve on several editorial boards and councils of scientific 
        societies. </p>
      <p><b>What do you like best about your career? </b><br>
        Being able to use a range of skills- writing, public speaking, drawing, 
        photography, fish-collecting. Traveling. Publishing. Developing strong 
        working relationships with a variety of colleagues throughout the world. 
        Mentoring students and encouraging colleagues, especially other women. 
      </p>
      <p><b>What would be your most important piece of advice for someone considering 
        the career you're in now?</b> <br>
        Be yourself. It's easy, and you don't have to practice. Laugh often, especially 
        at yourself. </p>
