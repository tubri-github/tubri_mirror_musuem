      <p><b>How did you first become interested in ichthyology? </b><br>
        In college I worked one summer as a fisheries aid and made several collections 
        of fishes in the Midwest. To have the fish identified correctly we took 
        them to the Illinois Natural History Survey and there I met my future 
        graduate advisor (Philip W. Smith) and one of my closest colleagues (Larry 
        M. Page). I was very impressed by their ability to spot identify every 
        fish we had collected.</p>
      <p><b>What steps did you have to take to get where you are today? </b><br>
        After completing my doctoral studies and finding a tenure-track academic 
        position I would say that learning how to obtain grant/contract funds 
        to support graduate students and research was probably the biggest challenge 
        and the biggest pressure outside of teaching and publishing research results.</p>
      <p><b>What kinds of skills are required for your career?</b> <br>
        What experiences do you feel prepared you best for your job? Various field 
        skills related to different sampling designs for ecological and life history 
        studies of freshwater fishes. Learning how to write a scientific paper. 
        Gaining experience in communicating effectively in meetings where grant 
        funds are at stake. Knowing the literature on North American fishes and 
        knowing where the interesting problems are for future studies.</p>
      <p><b>What are your responsibilities? </b><br>
        Teaching (about 50% time), research (about 35% time), Director of Undergraduate 
        Studies (about 15% time). I have 11 graduate students working on a variety 
        of problems that focus on the systematics or ecology of both North and 
        South American fishes. I spend a fair amount of time talking with our 
        230 undergraduate majors trying to help them to see zoology as a valid 
        career option.</p>
      <p><b>What do you like best about your career?</b> <br>
        I have enjoyed traveling and seeing fishes both here and in foreign countries; 
        getting to know my ichthyological colleagues at other institutions; working 
        with graduate students and enjoying their progress and success. I am still 
        fascinated by the tremendous diversity of freshwater fishes and I know 
        that I will continue to be interested in academic questions related to 
        fish biology and systematics.</p>
      <p><br>
        <b>What would be your most important piece of advice for someone considering 
        the career you're in now? </b><br>
        Get experience teaching the lecture and laboratory portions of freshman-level 
        biology classes. Make contacts with personnel at agencies that deal with 
        natural resources and find out what kind of research is needed. Go to 
        the meetings where agency personnel discuss their upcoming projects. Collaborate 
        with others in related fields to put together research proposals that 
        are multifaceted. Talk with the program officers at NSF and find out what 
        they are planning for in the future. Publish your work in journals with 
        a wide audience. Go to professional society meetings and get to know your 
        colleagues and their students.</p>
