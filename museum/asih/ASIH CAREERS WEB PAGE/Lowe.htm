      <p><b>How did you first become interested in ichthyology?</b><br>
        I grew up on a small island off the New England coast. There wasn't anything 
        else to do but fish, dive, fish&#133; Plus, my Mom's family had been commercial 
        fishers and whalers in New England since the 1600s, so I guess my heritage 
        kind of steered my career path. </p>
      <p><b>What steps did you have to take to get where you are today?</b><br>
        Worked my butt off! Not being the sharpest tack in the wall, I had to 
        work harder than most to get where I am now. Probably the smartest thing 
        I did was surround myself with the best and brightest. Working with people 
        like Don Nelson, Dick Bray, Kim Holland, Tim Tricas and many other exceptional 
        ichthyologists, really helped develop my abilities and approach to science.</p>
      <p>Also, I think the side projects and diversions I entertained in my graduate 
        career helped me get a tenure-track job faster. It might have taken me 
        longer to get through grad school, but I was able to avoid post-docing 
        by racking up some good pubs from side projects as they popped up. Again, 
        working with colleagues like Brad Wetherbee, Carl Meyer, and Jerry Crow 
        certainly help make the process fun and rewarding. As I look back, we 
        certainly accomplished a lot as grad students.</p>
      <p><b>What kinds of skills are required for your career? What experiences 
        do you feel prepared you best for your job?</b><br>
        As an assistant professor at a major comprehensive University, the most 
        valuable skill I need is the ability to &quot;juggle!&quot; In my faculty 
        position, my time is supposed to be split into 50% teaching and 50% research. 
        I consider myself very fortunate in that teaching comes somewhat easy 
        to me, but nevertheless, most students have no idea exactly how much time 
        goes into preparing lectures and laboratories. In addition, writing grants, 
        establishing a research lab and coordinating students, collecting data 
        and publishing are also incredibly time consuming. So, being able to &quot;juggle&quot; 
        teaching commitments and maintaining an active research program is incredibly 
        challenging. Being organized, a good communicator and leader are essential. 
        I gained a lot of those skills in grad school working in great labs like 
        Kim Holland's at the University of Hawaii. In his lab, we worked as a 
        team and were given a lot of responsibility as graduate students. We were 
        involved in every step of the scientific process, from grant preparation 
        to writing up the manuscripts. It was excellent training for my current 
        job. Learning how to balance those responsibilities and maintain my own 
        research effort helped me hone multi-tasking abilities.</p>
      <p><b>What are your responsibilities?</b> <br>
        As mentioned above, my responsibilities are equally split between teaching 
        and research. I teach between 1-3 classes per semester (both undergraduate 
        and graduate) and serve on departmental, college, and University committees. 
        I am expected to maintain an active research program and bring in grants. 
        I am expected to mentor undergraduate and graduate students.</p>
      <p><b>What do you like best about your career?</b> <br>
        The diversity! Every day is an adventure and you never know what new opportunity 
        will pop up. One of the unique aspects of academia is that you have the 
        freedom to pursue so many different areas of research. Being able to try 
        new things and learn new techniques, helps keep it fresh. </p>
      <p>I also really enjoy my interactions with students. Although there are 
        days when you want to set them adrift in a disabled boat, it's amazing 
        to watch them develop.</p>
      <p><b>What would be your most important piece of advice for someone considering 
        the career you're in now?</b> <br>
        Take advantage of all the opportunities you can as you're going through 
        school. Volunteer to work in someone's lab, even if it's part time. Travel 
        every opportunity you get! Learn to be a sponge - just &quot;shut up&quot; 
        and absorb. Learn to ask &quot;good&quot; questions. Develop your writing 
        and speaking skills. These are absolutely essential in my line of work. 
        Make sure you REALLY love it (i.e., being a professor). If you don't, 
        you will find that this job is way too much work for way too little money. 
        But, if you really love it, none of that other stuff will really matter!</p>
