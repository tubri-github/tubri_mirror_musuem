      <p><b>How did you first become interested in ichthyology?</b><br>
        At age 16 I knew I would be an ichthyologist, probably due to the years 
        spend snorkeling and spearfishing on the reefs of Jamaica, my birth place. 
      </p>
      <p><b>What steps did you have to take to get where you are today?</b><br>
        Started by reading &quot;The History of Fishes&quot; at 16 years of age 
        and never stopped planning my career. I worked at marine labs throughout 
        my high school years and then conducted three years of independent study 
        at Duke as an undergrad in Zoology. From there I continued my dream by 
        taking as many related courses as possible and never turning down an opportunity 
        to partake in fish research.</p>
      <p><b>What kinds of skills are required for your career? What experiences 
        do you feel prepared you best for your job?</b><br>
        Writing skills first and foremost, then critical thinking, reading of 
        as many papers in the field as possible (get off the internet and read 
        papers!), statistical ability, the ability to design and execute scientific 
        projects, and ability to publish your work. No, SCUBA diving ability has 
        little to do with your success so don't list it first on your resume.</p>
      <p><b>What are your responsibilities?</b><br>
        Competent teaching at the undergraduate and graduate level, advising students 
        at all levels, conducting scientific research, writing and publishing 
        papers, writing grant proposals and securing external monies to conduct 
        research, serving my department and university through committee work 
        and the like, serving my societies such as ASIH and AES, and grading papers, 
        writing letters of recommendation, and taking the time to fill out paperwork 
        like this.</p>
      <p><b>What do you like best about your career?</b><br>
        The ability to mentor graduate students and conduct research of my choice. 
        Not to mention traveling to cool places, diving with my animals, drinking 
        beer with my graduate students, and never having to punch a clock. I rest 
        my case.</p>
      <p><b>What would be your most important piece of advice for someone considering 
        the career you're in now? </b><br>
        Never give up on your dream, but plan for it in the smallest detail. It's 
        rarely luck that gets you into that dream job. Work and study hard, go 
        the extra mile, get involved with research from an early age in your career, 
        and start publishing your work when you're an undergraduate. Don't be 
        fixed on one type of animal or study area too early, you will have plenty 
        of time to do that later on. Get a broad undergraduate education in all 
        areas of biology, and then in graduate school specialize but not to the 
        point of myopia.</p>
