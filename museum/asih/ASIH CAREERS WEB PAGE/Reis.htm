      <p><b>How did you first become interested in ichthyology?<br>
        </b>As far as I can tell, I am fond of fishes since I was a small kid&#133; 
        My mother says that my first work was &quot;peixe&quot; (fish, in Portuguese)&#133; 
        even before mama or papa !! I remember catching a few characins and keeping 
        them in a glass jar during my family vacations when I was around ten !! 
        Since then, I got more and more interested in fishes and became seriously 
        interested when my father gave me an aquarium book&#133; During high school 
        I was an aquarist, as time permitted, and got really interested in ichthyology 
        during those years. Before entering the University I already knew that 
        I was going to be a professional ichthyologist! </p>
      <p><b><br>
        What steps did you have to take to get where you are today?<br>
        </b>Studying hard is the key in all cases. After finishing the University 
        I took the Master's course, a step usually taken in Brazil before the 
        Ph.D. Obviously, a good amount of luck is always necessary to be in the 
        right place at the right time. Unlike at present days, 20 years ago we 
        had only a handful of trained ichthyologists in Brazil, and I was lucky 
        enough to get a job in an university with a museum. There I started to 
        work on fish taxonomy and systematics, and to teach zoology in the undergrad 
        course. After finishing my Ph.D. I went for a one-year post-doc at the 
        University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, to complete my formal training. </p>
      <p>During the last 10 years I participated in all ichthyology meetings that 
        time and money permitted, tried to keep a high standard in scientific 
        publications (by selecting the best works in my area and following those 
        standards), managed to be a good professor and advisor to my own students, 
        and got engaged in projects and activities that I thought had the potential 
        to be useful to the ichthyological community. </p>
      <p><br>
        <b>What kinds of skills are required for your career? What experiences 
        do you feel prepared you best for your job?<br>
        </b>As any scientist, an ichthyologist must be a curious person. Ability 
        to deal with details, persistency, enthusiasm, dedication, and patience 
        are basic skills. You must be prepared to work very hard, and even though 
        realize that you'll only learn a small fraction of what can be discovered. 
        A great amount of love for the Nature is also advisable.</p>
      <p>In my case, what probably prepared me best for my job was my enthusiasm. 
        Because of it, I managed to participate in many meeting and actually met 
        other ichthyologists, I took part in many scientific expeditions, and 
        I studied as much as I could. Indeed the formal training definitely prepares 
        you for your job, but the other things you do besides the formal training 
        are the ones that count more!</p>
      <p><br>
        <b>What are your responsibilities?</b></p>
      <p>As most professors, I have to teach undergrad and grad courses. I teach 
        &quot;Cordates Zoology I&quot; (protocordates &amp; fishes) every semester 
        for the undergrad course. In the Graduate Program I teach &quot;Phylogenetic 
        Systematics&quot; and &quot;Ichthyology&quot; in alternate semesters. 
        Further on teaching classes, I act as an advisor for students taking their 
        graduate courses, and most of my students work on systematics of Neotropical 
        fishes.</p>
      <p>As a curator of fishes and a researcher, my responsibilities include 
        keeping the collection of fishes at MCP (a task shared with other curators 
        and collections manager). The funniest part, however, is to increase the 
        collection: going to the field and collecting fishes! In my opinion, actually 
        collecting the fishes you'll eventually work on gives you a much clearer 
        understanding of their ecology and biology, and a general knowledge about 
        fish diversity. Sum to these practical issues the fact that fishing is 
        one of the best activities one can spend the time in !! </p>
      <p><br>
        <b>What do you like best about your career?<br>
        </b>I think it is kind of apparent from the above that traveling into 
        the field is probably what I like best about being an ichthyologist. In 
        fact, I love fish, and being able to study them and contribute to the 
        understanding of their diversity and evolution is what makes me wake up 
        every morning (further on the alarm clock!).</p>
      <p><b><br>
        What would be your most important piece of advice for someone considering 
        the career you're in now?<br>
        </b>It's a great career! - but it's not for everyone. You must love Nature 
        and fish, must like to study hard, and must feel it really compensating 
        to see your student teaching you things that you taught them how to discover. 
        You must like to sleep in tents or hammocks, travel tourism class, and 
        take lots of mosquito bites&#133; I love it!<br>
