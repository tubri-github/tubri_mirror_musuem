        <b>How did you first become interested in ichthyology? </b><br>
        Aside from having gills in utero, it just seemed a natural. The fishes 
        make and break every rule-an admirable trait. They are as wildly creative 
        as you can be whilst remaining a vertebrate. </p>
      <p><b>What steps did you have to take to get where you are today?</b><br>
        College and grad school were tremendously important-especially the advice 
        and encouragement I was given by my family, advisors and committee members. 
        The opportunities my grad school advisor offered me led to my present 
        job.</p>
      <p><b>What kinds of skills are required for your career? What experiences 
        do you feel prepared you best for your job?</b><br>
        I work in an extremely collaborative environment-it literally takes a 
        small army to make even a small film. So being comfortable working on 
        a team is very important. The ability to assimilate an enormous amount 
        of material, weave a fast story and persuasively paint a picture as to 
        why the subject matter is worth covering-those are important skills as 
        well. I draw on editing skills constantly.</p>
      <p><b>What are your responsibilities?</b><br>
        I wear several hats here since we are a tiny company. Some of my responsibilities 
        include:<br>
        Story developer for new projects<br>
        Locating the perfect character for the story<br>
        Writing NSF grants and many others in search of funding<br>
        Checking and rechecking that we've got our facts straight.<br>
        Designing educational outreach materials to accompany our broadcast media.</p>
      <p><b>What do you like best about your career?</b><br>
        My job has tremendous variety, the material I deal with is constantly 
        intellectually challenging and thought-provoking and my co-workers are 
        tremendous<br>
        <br>
        <b>What would be your most important piece of advice for someone considering 
        the career you're in now? </b><br>
        Be patient yet tenacious. <br>
        Attend film festivals showing the films you most want to make. <br>
        Be bold and make contacts. <br>
        Try to get an AAAS mass media fellowship in television.<br>
        Talk to as many people as you can in the field. I have a very rosy view 
        of working in television-many people might have quite a different view 
        from me.</p>
      <p>Good luck!</p>
