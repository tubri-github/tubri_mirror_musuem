      <p><b>How did you first become interested in ichthyology?</b><br>
        Inspired by Dr. David Etnier when I was an undergraduate research participate 
        and student in his ichthyology course.</p>
      <p><b>What steps did you have to take to get where you are today?</b><br>
        Secured a M.S. in Fisheries and Wildlife Science, worked for 5 years as 
        a stream survey team biologist in Kentucky, returned for Ph.D. to work 
        under Dr. Brooks Burr at Southern Illinois University, took a year-long 
        post-doc with Dr. Paul Angermeier at Virginia Tech, took job as Research 
        Biologist (emphasis aquatic conservation and stream ecology), ultimately 
        took on Team Leader role in present position.</p>
      <p><b>What kinds of skills are required for your career? What experiences 
        do you feel prepared you best for your job?</b><br>
        The -ology courses (ichthyology, aquatic entomology, limnology, etc.) 
        were foundational. Extensive experience in stream and small river surveys 
        were essential. A broad graduate education, covering taxonomy (Ph.D.), 
        conservation (endangered species work), working with game fish (M.S.), 
        and stream ecology (GIS, zoogeography) (post-doc). I feel my experience 
        in preparing and writing scientific papers (from notes to full-blown papers 
        to book chapters to books) was a pivotal skill as well as a strong background 
        in applied statistics. Participating in leadership positions (both societal 
        and agency related) are experiences from which I have better developed 
        my ability to coordinate people, reach goals, and produce research products.</p>
      <p><b>What are your responsibilities?</b><br>
        I supervise 3 research scientists (two aquatic ecologists and one ornithologist), 
        3 biological technicians (up to 9 additional during summer), a computer 
        programmer, and 2 administrative personnel. I am responsible for all aspects 
        of our units program (funding, budget, physical plant, fleet, and research 
        productivity) concerning aquatic and terrestrial ecology, the latter being 
        handled primarily by one of my scientists (an ornithologist). I am also 
        a Group Leader (Aquatic Ecology) for a large-scale ecosystem management 
        research project in the Ouachita Mountains. I work with university researchers 
        in designing and implementing research on the stream systems in that region. 
        At this time, I am an Associate Editor for the North American Journal 
        of Fisheries Management (will switch to Transactions of the American Fisheries 
        Society this fall) and I am Science Editor for Fisheries. I enjoy editing.</p>
      <p><b>What do you like best about your career?</b><br>
        I have an extraordinary amount of scientific freedom to pursue research 
        questions and develop research programs. I am able to spend a lot of time 
        in the field with generally adequate to excellent equipment, transportation, 
        funding, and technical support. I am engaged professionally in societal 
        participation (primarily AFS and ASIH) and enjoy that aspect of my job. 
        I also generally enjoy my editing assignments. Lastly, I enjoy working 
        with other bright, young scientists and helping them develop professionally. 
      </p>
      <p><b>What would be your most important piece of advice for someone considering 
        the career you're in now?</b> <br>
        Use graduate school time wisely. Pick well-conceived projects, finish 
        them on time, and move on. If opportunities arise to do field work with 
        others, do it. Field experience is paramount and the broader that experience 
        (whether the tasks or the geography) the better. </p>
