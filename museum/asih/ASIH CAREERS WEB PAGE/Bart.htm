      <p><b>How did you first become interested in ichthyology?</b><br>
        Childhood fascination with fish and fishing </p>
      <p><b>What steps did you have to take to get where you are today?</b><br>
        After completing my Ph.D., I worked as a Visiting Assistant Professor 
        at the University of Illinois (teaching postdoc), and an Assistant Professor 
        and Fishes Curator at Auburn University. I got my current job (my dream 
        job) in 1992, 7 years after completing my Ph.D. degree. </p>
      <p><b>What kinds of skills are required for your career? What experiences 
        do you feel prepared you best for your job?</b><br>
        Museum curation, knowledge of vertebrates in general and fish in particular, 
        experience with morphology-based systematics, field experience.</p>
      <p><b>What are your responsibilities?</b><br>
        I curate one of the largest fish collections in the world. I supervise 
        a staff of 5 people who assist with this task. I teach upper-level courses 
        on the Tulane campus (including general ichthyology) and train graduate 
        students. </p>
      <p><b>What do you like best about your career?</b><br>
        I really love collecting fish, and studying fish specimens in the lab. 
        I am also dedicated to conservation of imperiled fishes. </p>
      <p><b>What would be your most important piece of advice for someone considering 
        the career you're in now? </b><br>
        I know this sounds clich&eacute;, but the key to success is determination 
        and hard work. In the academic arena, it is also important to be collegial 
        and a good communicator. Of course, one also has to do good work. </p>
