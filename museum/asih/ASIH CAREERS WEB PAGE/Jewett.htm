      <p><b>How did you first become interested in ichthyology?</b> <br>
        Grew up by the seashore &#133; did a lot of snorkeling (and collecting) 
        as a kid.</p>
      <p><b>What steps did you have to take to get where you are today?</b> <br>
        Actually I made some mistakes and landed here. I had a good solid background 
        in zoology, including a course in ichthyology. However, I gave up my graduate 
        schooling to put a husband through school, came to Washington with him, 
        and started here as an entry-level technician. I worked my way up from 
        there and never made it back into graduate school.</p>
      <p><b>What kinds of skills are required for your career?</b> <br>
        Attention to details, common sense, some familiarity with ichthyology. 
        Most of the rest is learned on the job.</p>
      <p><b>What experiences do you feel prepared you best for your job?</b> <br>
        Field work collecting fish while in college/graduate school.</p>
      <p><b>What are your responsibilities?</b> <br>
        I share management of the Smithsonian's NMNH fish collection with one 
        other person. My duties include responsibility for the &quot;loan&quot; 
        program which includes servicing requests for loans, exchanges, donations, 
        etc. of fish, and information about fish or other things pertaining to 
        our collection. I also manage the physical maintenance of the collection 
        and supervise collections management staff in both of the above activities. 
        Other responsibilities include planning new facilities, moving collections, 
        occasional field work, public outreach, participation in the development 
        of policy and practices on a local and pan-institutional level, and many 
        miscellaneous activities.</p>
      <p><b>What do you like best about your career?</b> <br>
        Field work, interaction with scientists worldwide, and public outreach.</p>
      <p><b>What would be your most important piece of advice for someone considering 
        the career you're in now? </b><br>
        Obtain a good basic biology education including exposure to taxonomy/systematics. 
        Make sure you enjoy working in a museum environment (not always exciting) 
        and working with specimen collections. Be adept at various computer applications 
        (e.g. Word, Access, Excel, Powerpoint at the minimum). Don't expect to 
        make a lot of money or spend a lot of time doing fieldwork. Be service-oriented 
        and good-natured about it.</p>
