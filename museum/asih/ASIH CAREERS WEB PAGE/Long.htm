      <p><b>How did you first become interested in ichthyology?</b><br>
        Whilst being an amateur fossil collector as a child, I realised that many 
        people had done work on the fossil mammals and reptiles, but very few 
        had looked at the fish fossils in my area, so I became very interested 
        in them.</p>
      <p><b>What steps did you have to take to get where you are today?</b><br>
        I did an Honours year (4th year) geology thesis on the placoderm fish 
        Bothriolepis from Victoria, Australia, then went on to do a Ph.D on the 
        extraordinary Middle Devonian Mt Howitt fossil fish fauna (also from Victoria), 
        which contained many new species of placoderms, acanthodians,<br>
        lungfishes, osteolepiforms, actinopterygians and a primitive coelacanth.</p>
      <p><b>What kinds of skills are required for your career? What experiences 
        do you feel prepared you best for your job?</b><br>
        A combination of studying zoology and geology at University, plus an early 
        gained amateur knowledge of palaeontology from my childhood fossil collecting 
        days.</p>
      <p><b>What are your responsibilities?</b><br>
        I manage the fossil vertebrate collections, undertake researh primarily 
        on fossil fishes (including regular fieldwork collecting specimens both 
        locally and internationally), I provide information to Government and 
        the public about fossils, and often give public or academic lectures about 
        palaeontology.</p>
      <p><b>What do you like best about your career?</b><br>
        Fieldwork- the thrill of discovering new species that provide important 
        information about the evolution of early fishes.</p>
      <p><b>What would be your most important piece of advice for someone considering 
        the career you're in now?</b><br>
        Think carefully before embarking on a palaeontological career-job prospects 
        are always minimal. But, if you are prepared to work hard, and publish 
        lots of good research papers, jobs can always be created through research 
        grants for good palaeontologists. It is a very satisfying and interesting 
        career.<br>
