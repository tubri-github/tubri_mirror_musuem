      <p>Ichthyology is the scientific study of fishes. An ichthyologist is a 
        person who devotes a career to studying some of the estimated 25,000 to 
        30,000 species of bony fishes, sharks, rays, and lobe-finned fishes. Areas 
        of specialty are as varied as the people who call themselves ichthyologists, 
        and may include study of classification, life history, anatomy, behavior, 
        ecology or physiology, and aquarium maintenance, fish breeding, and conservation. 
        What ichthyologists have in common is a fascination and enduring curiosity 
        about fishes, the dominant vertebrate animals in marine and fresh waters. 
        In addition to being the most species-rich group of vertebrates, fishes 
        are often used as experimental models for demonstration of basic biological 
        principles.</p>
      <p>The purpose of this pamphlet is to introduce various careers ichthyologists 
        pursue. Students of ichthyology, as well as other fields of biology and 
        the sciences in general, may be bewildered in their search for a job that 
        they feel best suits their interests and training. Today, there is increasing 
        public and scientific interest in conserving natural aquatic habitats, 
        such as coastal wetlands and coral reefs. This desire to conserve natural 
        biological diversity should realistically result in more support for study 
        of fishes, as well as all of biology and the sciences, and increase job 
        opportunities.</p>
      <p>Jobs in which fishes are used in basic research and teaching are emphasized 
        in this pamphlet, rather than management of fishery resources, which may 
        involve shellfish or aquatic mammals as well as fishes. We refer students 
        interested principally in a career in fisheries to two excellent brochures, 
        &quot;Careers in Fisheries&quot; and &quot;Fisheries Programs and Related 
        Courses at North American Colleges and Universities&quot; available by 
        writing to the American Fisheries Society, 54 10 Grosvenor Lane, Bethesda, 
        Maryland 20814.</p>
      <p>Choices are vast. A student focused on a realistic goal has a good chance 
        of ultimately achieving that goal. Ichthyologists at various times during 
        their training, as well as throughout their careers, should discuss their 
        goals with others. Success and fulfillment in the field of ichthyology 
        has been achieved in many ways.</p>
      <hr>
      <p align="center"><a name="education"></a><b>EDUCATIONAL PREPARATION</b><br>
      </p>
      <p>Few careers in ichthyology are open to people who have only a high school 
        diploma. A bachelor's degree is typically the minimum requirement for 
        technical-support positions. Most research and teaching positions require 
        a master's or doctoral degree, with many, particularly those at colleges, 
        universities, and major research institutions, requiring a Ph.D.</p>
      <p>Most students with an interest in ichthyology will major in Zoology or 
        Biology, but they should take courses in a broad range of subjects. Courses 
        in anatomy, development, statistics, systematics, biochemistry, behavior, 
        genetics, ecology, and physiology will increase chances of admission into 
        a good graduate program. Ichthyologists use a diversity of research methods 
        and techniques. A good background in use of computers is now almost mandatory. 
        Many ichthyologists conduct research in foreign countries or use non-English 
        literature in their research; consequently, familiarity with one or more 
        foreign languages is helpful. Specialized training, such as certification 
        as a SCUBA diver, can be also quite useful and rewarding.</p>
      <p>Many universities and colleges have graduate programs in ichthyology, 
        but programs and focus of research vary according to faculty interests. 
        Some of the more active graduate programs are at universities listed in 
        Table 1. Graduate training is also available through museums that are 
        associated with universities (Table 2).</p>
      <p>Students planning to pursue a career in ichthyology should, if possible, 
        talk with several ichthyologists who work in different disciplines (e.g., 
        systematics, behavior, or ecology). Such discussions can help students 
        decide which specialties most interest them and choose an appropriate 
        graduate program. If a college or university has an ichthyologist on staff, 
        a student can gain valuable first-hand experience assisting with the professor's 
        field and laboratory research. Often, encouragement by a professor early 
        in a student's career has been the deciding factor in his or her decision 
        to become an ichthyologist.</p>
      <p>The range of ichthyological research is reflected in articles published 
        in journals such as Copeia, Journal offish Biology, and Environmental 
        Biology of fishes. Attending an annual meeting of the American Society 
        of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists is also an excellent way to find 
        out about the latest directions in ichthyology. Such meetings present 
        an opportunity to talk with potential graduate school advisors. Volunteering 
        at a public aquarium or museum with a fish collection can provide insights 
        into ichthyological research, may result in useful contacts, and lead 
        to a paying job.</p>

      <p align="center">Applied Research</p>
      <p>Numerous federal, state and local agencies, such as the United States 
        Fish and Wildlife Service, the Environmental Protection Agency, the National 
        Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (including the National Marine 
        Fisheries Service), and state fish and game administrations employ ichthyologists 
        in research and administrative positions. Responsibilities of these agencies 
        include management and development of commercial and sport fishing regulations, 
        regulating use of coastal and wetland areas for recreation, identification 
        of commercial adult and larval fish populations, and protection of endangered 
        or threatened species. Research on particular fish groups is often dictated 
        by current and anticipated economic need. Publications by these researchers 
        may include species identification sheets, larval fish identification 
        guides, world-wide species catalogues, and monographic systematic revisions. 
        Job prospects are moderately good, and for some positions, just a bachelor's 
        or master's degree is required.</p>
      <p align="center">Career Profiles:</p>
      <p align="center"><a href="Warren.htm">Dr. Mell Warren</a></p>
      <p align="center">College and University Teaching and Research</p>
      <p>Many Ph.D. ichthyologists seek employment as college or university professors 
        and instructors where their primary responsibilities are teaching, research 
        and administration. Teaching can be immensely rewarding and is ideal for 
        someone who likes to communicate the world of biology. Courses taught 
        by ichthyologists usually include general biology and one or more specialized 
        courses such as comparative anatomy, behavior, biometry, ecology, or systematics, 
        in addition to ichthyology.</p>
      <p>Job performance is evaluated on number and quality of published research 
        papers, teaching performance, and ability to get grants to support research 
        projects. Research funding is available from a variety of private or public 
        agencies. The National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of 
        Health, and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service are three major 
        public sources of research funds. The National Geographic Society, The 
        Nature Conservancy, and the World Wildlife Fund are but a few of the private 
        sources of research funding.</p>
      <p>Colleges and universities also employ people with a bachelor's and master's 
        degree as teaching or research assistants. There is little opportunity 
        for individual research at such levels, but fieldwork is often possible.</p>
      <p>During the 1990s it is estimated that nearly one-half of all college 
        and university-level teachers in the United States will reach retirement 
        age. Even though not all of these positions will be refilled, and there 
        may be a large number of applicants for some positions, prospects for 
        employment at a college or university are reasonably good.</p>

      <p align="center">Museum Curatorship</p>
      <p>Collection-based, systematic ichthyological research and curation of 
        a preserved fish collection are the two major responsibilities of a museum 
        curator. Many museum curators conduct research on a particular group of 
        fishes, examining preserved fish specimens as a primary source of data. 
        Systematic ichthyology is the comparative study and classification of 
        fish groups and includes naming new species and description of differences 
        among fish groups. Most major natural history museums have molecular systematic 
        laboratories, where genetic data, such as DNA sequences, can be analyzed. 
        Opportunities for fieldwork, especially to collect fish specimens in areas 
        that people are altering rapidly, such as the tropical rainforest, are 
        abundant.</p>
      <p>Duties in addition to research are broad. Exhibit development, public 
        lectures, service on committees, advising postdoctoral students, and fund-raising, 
        as well as overseeing collection maintenance by a collection management 
        staff, round out the day of a museum curator. Opportunities for teaching 
        are limited unless the museum is part of a university. In that case, curators 
        may also serve as professors and divide their duties accordingly. Promotion 
        and evaluation of job performance are based principally on published research 
        papers, which often include monographic systematic revisions.</p>
      <p>A postdoctoral fellowship - one or perhaps two years of independent research 
        following award of the Ph.D. in a major museum is helpful to develop skills 
        and contacts. Job openings for museum curators are quite limited, and 
        although there is stiff competition, vacancies occur almost every year.</p>

      <p align="center">Collection Management</p>
      <p>Collection management is a rapidly developing field, especially as automated 
        databases and information retrieval networks become commonplace. Collection 
        managers work in museums where fish collections are maintained. They are 
        responsible for the proper preservation and handling of fish specimens, 
        maintaining records, and assuring that the collection is accessible to 
        other scientists for study. The modem collection manager is at home with 
        computer cataloging systems, and also may participate in identification 
        of specimens and development of specimen conservation policy. Opportunity 
        for individual research and fieldwork is limited.</p>
      <p>Most major museums and universities with collections have as a high priority 
        the hiring of collection management personnel and new positions have been 
        created recently. Graduate students often support themselves as part-time 
        collection managers.</p>

      <p align="center">Public Aquaria and the Aquarium Hobby</p>
      <p>Public aquaria are very popular. Nearly every major American city now 
        has or is planning to have an aquarium. Jobs include aquarium maintenance 
        and animal keeping, exhibit development, education, public outreach, and 
        research on captive breeding and other aspects of maintaining live aquatic 
        animal populations. Collecting trips can be an exciting part of the life 
        of an aquarium employee.</p>
      <p align="center">Careers Profiles:</p>
      <p align="center"><a href="Conklin.htm">Dan Conklin</a></p>
      <p>The aquarium hobby is a financially robust, multi-million-dollar-a-year-industry. 
        Employment may be found in an aquarium store or on the editorial staff 
        of aquarium publications. Commercial importing and breeding of fishes 
        can be lucrative, although it requires as much knowledge of how to run 
        a business as how to breed fishes.</p>
      <p align="center">Conservation Biology</p>
      <p>The number of conservation agencies, such as Conservation International, 
        the World Wildlife Fund, The Nature Conservancy, and the Center for Marine 
        Conservation just to name a few, has increased considerably along with 
        great concern for the impact humans have upon the environment. Ichthyologists 
        at these agencies work with other biologists to develop conservation plans 
        for species and species communities. Much time may be spent preparing 
        reports, such as environmental impact statements or proposals for nature 
        reserves. There is limited opportunity for individual research projects. 
        Often, just a bachelor's or master's degree is required.</p>
