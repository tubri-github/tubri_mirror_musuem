<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">1) USFWS is 
accessing a web site for old surveys that were done in the early 1900's for a 
specified area on Bogue Chitto National Wildlife Refuge. &nbsp;The old surveys 
describe &quot;witness trees&quot; at certain geographical points. &nbsp;We want a list of the 
witness trees at the given point to be able to determine species for restoration 
and historical purposes. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">2) &nbsp;A second 
project will be to take data recorded at a restoration site on Breton Island 
National Wildlife Refuge and put it into an Excel data file and give us this on 
a CD. &nbsp;The data relates to elevations taken at sand fences erected to trap sand 
and create dunes. &nbsp;Unfortunately, the fences and accumulated sand were wiped out 
by the recent hurricanes, but we still need the data for future planning. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">3) A third project will be to 
take written data on the endangered red cockaded woodpecker from a data book and 
create an Excel file and give us this on a CD. &nbsp;As part of this project, 
students can help with roost surveys conducted during February and March to 
determine population estimates. &nbsp;Each project can include a site visit to the 
refuge the work was done on if desired. &nbsp;We recommend one trip by all students 
for orientation and description of projects as we did previously.</font><span style="font-family: sans-serif">

Under the direction of the Department of the Interior, the National Park 
Service’s (NPS) was established in 1916 with the mission <i>&quot;...to promote and 
regulate the use of the...national parks...which purpose is to conserve the 
scenery and the natural and historic objects and the wild life therein and to 
provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as will 
leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations.&quot; </i>&nbsp;As 
landscapes continue to change in dramatic ways, it becomes even more pressing to 
preserve natural and historical resources for the benefit of future generations.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve (JELA) 
was established in 1978 in order to <i>“…preserve for the education, 
inspiration, and benefit of present and future generations significant examples 
of natural and historical resources of the Mississippi Delta region and to 
provide for their interpretation in such manner as to portray the development of 
cultural diversity in the region.” &nbsp;</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;With the headquarters located in the 
French Quarter, JELA is comprised of several park units including Crescent City 
(Chalmette Battlefield, Chalmette Cemetery, French Quarter Site), Acadian (with 
locations in Eunice, Thibodaux, and Lafayette), and the Barataria Preserve.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Barataria Preserve is located 15 miles south of New 
Orleans along the eastern shore of Lake Salvador and is part of the ecologically 
significant Barataria Estuary.&nbsp; The 18,500-acre Preserve consists of three broad 
habitat types: bottomland hardwood forest, swamp, and marsh.&nbsp; The marsh at the 
Preserve is one of the largest portions of floating marsh in the world.&nbsp; The 
Preserve supports an abundance of wildlife and plant communities, including 
neotropical migrant songbirds, furbears, reptiles and amphibians, and 
commercially and recreationally important fin and shellfish. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Projects:</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if gte vml 1]><v:line id="_x0000_s1026"
 style='position:absolute;left:0;text-align:left;top:0;z-index:1' from="0,4.5pt"

v:shapes="_x0000_s1026"></span><![endif]></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The following projects are primarily data entry and 
analysis with some field work included.&nbsp; Project supervision will depend on the 
individual student’s skills and ability to work independently.&nbsp; Depending on 
student’s schedules, data entry can be completed independently and field work 
will be conducted according to researcher’s schedule.&nbsp; Although the main office 
for JELA is located in the French Quarter, field work will take place at the 
Barataria Preserve on the Westbank.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><i>Analyze Historic and Current Nutria Harvest Data and 
Assist with Radio Telemetry Research Project</i></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Barataria Preserve is plagued with non-native nutria 
which have historically caused eat-outs and destroyed marsh vegetation.&nbsp; The 
Preserve has allowed nutria trapping since the early 1980’s and currently has 
five trappers actively trying to reduce the nutria population.&nbsp; In order to 
accurately assess the number of nutria harvested on the Preserve and compare 
harvests among years, the number of acres trapped and effort needs to be taken 
into consideration.&nbsp; Students will input data into a database and make yearly 
comparisons.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In addition, students will have the opportunity to assist 
Lauren Nolfo (PhD candidate, Tulane University) with her research project 
examining the seasonal movements of nutria in the Preserve.&nbsp; Ms. Nolfo is using 
radio transmitters to determine movements and habitat associations.&nbsp; Field work 
will be coordinated with Ms. Nolfo and according to the student’s schedule. 
&nbsp;This will be a valuable opportunity to learn about radio telemetry, marsh 
vegetation, and nutria behavior.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><i>Compile White-tailed Deer Harvest Data and Assist 
with an Ongoing Research Project</i></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Barataria Preserve allows hunting of white-tailed deer 
during the annual state season.&nbsp; Harvest numbers and hunter effort fluctuate 
among years.&nbsp; Students will compile data from previous years and input it into a 
database.&nbsp; Information about the number of deer killed, age, and sex needs to be 
analyzed to evaluate harvest activities and the health of the herd.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Students will also have the opportunity to participate in 
an ongoing LSU research project.&nbsp; Researchers from Louisiana State University 
have been working on a project to quantify the population of white-tailed deer 
on the Preserve and develop harvest recommendations.&nbsp; In order to assess deer 
herbivory and forest regeneration, exclosures were established and seedlings 
were planted inside.&nbsp; Students will assist researchers in measuring the height 
of planted seedlings and removing them from the exclosure, and 
constructing/repairing exclosures, as needed.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><i>Input Breeding Bird Survey Data into Database for 
Analysis</i></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Breeding bird surveys have been conducted on the Barataria 
Preserve.&nbsp; Much of this data is unable to be analyzed because it is in the form 
of raw data sheets and not in a database.&nbsp; This information is of interest to 
the Park to determine trends in species diversity and abundance.&nbsp; Students will 
be required to enter data into a database and conduct a literature search of 
avian research conducted in the Preserve and at areas with similar habitats.&nbsp;

three projects outlined below as service learning options all involve research 
that students can do primarily from campus.&nbsp; However, students will have the 
opportunity to visit preserves at least once during the semester, to do various 
kinds of volunteer work on premises.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>1)</b>&nbsp; <b>Forest Legacy Program</b> - this is a new 
federal program through the US Forest Service.&nbsp; Each state must apply for the 
program.&nbsp; This year TNC is working with the state Office of Forestry to complete 
the application.&nbsp; The State of Louisiana is contracting with TNC to complete an 
&quot;Assessment of need&quot;.&nbsp; TNC is looking for students to do research and find 
examples of similar assessments from other states, which TNC can use as models, 
and general information that should go into these reports.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>2) Research on habitat and ecological needs of species 
at risk in the Pearl River and major tributaries.</b>&nbsp; &nbsp;TNC is working with 
state and federal agencies to conserve the unique biodiversity in the Pearl 
River system and to learn more about the ecology of its most vulnerable 
species.&nbsp; Information is needed on the habitat and other ecological needs of 
rare or declining fishes (e.g., Gulf sturgeon), turtles (e.g., ring sawback 
turtle) and mussels in the Pearl River system.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>3) Restoration of sand and gravel mines in the 
southeast.</b>&nbsp; Sedimentation resulting from sand and gravel mining is a major 
factor contributing to degradation of the Pearl River.&nbsp; TNC is working with the 
aggregate industry to promote Best Management Practices (BMP's) in sand and 
gravel mining that ensure stream quality.&nbsp; TNC has a preserve on the Pearl River 
in Mississippi called Mike's Island that has some old gravel mine sites that are 
in need restoration.&nbsp; Students would do research into BMP’s for sand and gravel 
mining.</p>
