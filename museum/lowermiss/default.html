<P><STRONG><U></U></STRONG><STRONG><U>Goal 2:</U> Implement a fish collection study to assess ecosystem health in the lower
Mississippi River .</STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	This aspect of the study will assess ecosystem health in the lower Mississippi River by
comparing fish contamination levels and indicators of  fish population and community health
(age, growth, condition, community composition and structure) in the industrialized reach of the
Mississippi River and neighboring water bodies .  Fish will be sampled monthly  at  four sites:
the Mississippi River at St. Francisville and Belle Chasse,  the Atchafalaya River below Morgan
City, and the Amite River at Port Vincent.  The Atchafalaya River site will serve as a within-basin reference site for assessing effects related to the Mississippi River's industrial corridor. The
Atchafalaya River is a distributary of the Mississippi River. It supports the same fish community
and offers similar fish habitat.  However, because the point of diversion from the Mississippi
(Simmesport, LA) is above the industrial corridor, the Atchafalaya is not affected by industrial
activity in the lower Mississippi River corridor.  Moreover, the Atchafalaya River's water quality
rating is higher than that in the lower corridor of the Mississippi River 
(<FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U>www.epa.gov</U></FONT>/surf2/hvcs/08080101/index.html). Fish collected from the Amite River at Port
Vincent will be used as a reference on tissue contamination levels in the Mississippi River Basin
(within and outside the industrial corridor).</P>

<P>   </P>

<P>The results of these comparisons will reveal  how the health of the lower Mississippi
River fish community differs  from those at less-industrialized reference sites, and the
relationship of this to tissue contamination differences between sites . <STRONG><EM></EM></STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG><EM>Experimental methods</EM></STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG><EM>	</EM></STRONG><EM></EM>Fish will be sampled quantitatively using a variety of methods, including boat
electrofishing, trammel nets, hoop nets, and seining.  Seines will be used only at the St.
Francisville and Belle Chasse to obtain collections of small fishes suitable for comparison to
early seine collections.  When river stage is too high to permit seining, small mesh entanglement
devices will be employed. Small fishes will be fixed in buffered formalin in the field and taken to
the Tulane Museum of Natural History for sorting, identification, and enumeration.  The samples
will be accessioned into the Museum for permanent record.  Large fish will be field identified,
measured to standard length, weighed , and either released alive or packed in ice and brought to
the laboratory for dissection and further study.  Prior to release, large fish will be tagged with
sequentially numbered anchor tags so that they can be identified if recaptured in the future.  A
few scales will be removed from the upper right side of all large fish collected for scale aging
purposes. Muscle and liver tissue will be dissected from  subsamples of gar (top predator) and
buffalo suckers (bottom feeders) collected.  The tissues will be transported to our  analytical
laboratory on ice for contaminant analysis. An Ekman grab will be used to sample bottom
sediments.  Sediment samples will be placed in glass containers with teflon-lined lids. 
Containers used to hold sediment samples for inorganic analysis will be acidified prior to
receiving sediment samples.  Sediment samples will also be transported on ice.<FONT FACE="CG Times">  </FONT>Sampling in the
Amite River will only target gar and buffalo for comparison of contamination levels. </P>

<P><STRONG></STRONG><STRONG><U>Goal 3.</U>  Establishment of a database of available fish data for the lower Mississippi River</STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	Fishes are the best known and most extensively studied group of organisms in the lower
Mississippi River, and yet public understanding about threats contaminants in the river pose to
this resource is poor.  A fair amount of historical fish data, dating back to the middle 1960's, is
available for the lower Mississippi River (Conner and Bryan 1974, Baker et al. 1991).  However,
the data are not in a form that would allow easy analysis and interpretation.  </P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	Collections archived in natural history museums represent one of the best sources of data
on lower Mississippi River fishes because catch data can be verified against specimens in the
museum.  Moreover, the specimens themselves can be studied, providing data on age, growth,
population structure, diet, parasitology, and other aspects of life history.  A number of fish
collections in the U.S. archive specimens and data from surveys of the lower Mississippi River.
One of the largest repositories is the fish collection in the Tulane University Museum of Natural
History, a "National Center of Ichthyology Resource Collection" (Poss and Collette 1995).</P>

<P>Archived in the Tulane Fish Collection are over 200 collections from the lower Mississippi
River.  The collections span a period of 43 years (1956-1998) and comprise a total of 139,000
specimens representing 133  species. Included are collections from three monthly fish-monitoring surveys: a survey of multiple sites in the vicinity of Baton Rouge and St</P>

<P>Francisville, LA (RM 240-290), conducted from October 1976 to December 1979; a survey of
the river at English Turn Bend (RM 78) conducted from January 1983 to August 1986; and a
survey conducted in the vicinity of Fort Jackson, LA (RM 19.7) from September 1986 to
December 1988.  Also included are periodic collections from Bonnet Carrie Spillway and a
number of other parts of the lower river.  All of the collections were made under the</P>

<P>supervision of Royal D. Suttkus (the founder and now Emeritus former Curator of Fishes of the
Tulane University Museum of Natural History) and all involved standardized gear (seines and
trammel nets) and sampling technique.  Material from the lower Mississippi River is also
archived in fish collections at Louisiana State University, Northeast Louisiana University,</P>

<P>and the University of Tennessee.  </P>

<P> </P>

<P>	A large portion of the available data on lower Mississippi River fishes was gathered by 
fisheries scientists working in universities, State Game and Fish agencies, and federal agencies
such as the Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.  Data from these
studies are generally of high scientific quality; however, because the specimens are rarely
archived, species identifications can not be verified and other details of life history cannot be
examined retrospectively verified.  Nevertheless, the data are useful for comparing changes in
species composition and condition (length-weight relationships) of individual fish species.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	All available data on fishes in the lower Mississippi River will be assembled into a
relational database, comparable to the water quality database.  The database will have two
components: a database of all field collections data, with fields for date, time, location,
temperature, gear-type, collectors, and remarks; and a database of fish data, with fields for
specimen number, species, sex, age, length, total weight, weights of various organs, contaminant
analysis results by tissue type, and several fields related to data quality.  The two databases will
be linked by a field collection number typically assigned in the field, or (as with archived
collections) assigned when the collection is accessioned.  As far as possible, each record in the
database will be linked to an actual specimen archived in a research collection.  All material
collected in connection with field work proposed above, and as much of the material from
previous surveys as can be located, will be cataloged into the Tulane Museum of Natural History
for permanent record.  Data from state and federal agencies, and from consulting firms that
employ the right kind of scientific expertise to ensure good data quality, will also be entered into
the database.   </P>

<P><STRONG><U>Goal 4.</U>  Fish community changes in space and time, and the relationship to river changes.</STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><STRONG><EM></EM></STRONG><EM></EM>  The fish database will allow us to examine changes in the fish community composition and
various aspects of fish life history in space and time.  The availability of the database on water
quality will enable us to relate the fish changes to water quality changes. One of the temporal
analyses that can be performed is a comparison of   contemporary seine collections made in the
vicinity of St. Francisville and Belle Chasse with the large group seine collections taken from
these areas of the river in the1970's and 1980's (now  archived in the Tulane Museum of Natural
History). Species catch data for these collections will be extracted from the fish  database and
imported into a spreadsheet.   The data set will be restricted to years represented by collections
taken in the same months as the contemporary collections.  Complementary historical and
contemporary data on river water quality will be obtained from  the water quality database.  The
data will be subjected to canonical correlation analysis and other ordination analyses (principal
components analysis, correspondence analysis) designed to reduce the many species and water-quality variables to correlated sets of variables that best explain how fish species composition
and dominance relationships have changed in the river between sites and surveys and how the
changes relate to water quality changes.   </P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	This research should shed considerable light on how fish populations and the overall fish
community are coping with current environmental conditions in the lower corridor of the
Mississippi River, and how the community has responded to recent changes in river quality. The
analysis of effects on growth, age/size structure, and average physical condition of common fish
species will reveal the extent, if any, to which fish populations are being negatively impacted by
contamination in the lower corridor of the Mississippi River. <FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT></P>
