<P>1. Draw a simple branching diagram to show phylogenetic relationships of agnathans, chondrichthyans, osteichthyans, and other vertebrates.  Where do acanthodians and placoderms fit in ? (10)</P>

<P>2. Name the two subclasses of bony fishes and give the distinguishing characteristics of each group.  Which group gave rise to tetrapods. (10)</P>

<P>3. Using gars, bowfin and teleosts as an example, draw simple diagrams to show the difference between evolutionary grades and clades, and relate these to synthetic and cladistic schools of classification (15).</P>
<P>      </P>
<P>4. List the four infradivisions of teleostian fishes and give a common or scientific name for a representative from each group. (10)</P>

<P>5. List the six superorders of euteleostian fishes and give a common or scientific name for a representative from each group. (15)</P>
