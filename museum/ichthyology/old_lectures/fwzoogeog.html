<B><P>Freshwater Zoogeography</P>
</B><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Zoogeography is the study of the distribution of animals. Freshwater <B>ichthyogeography</B> is concerned with the distributions of freshwater fishes and understanding how the various groups of freshwater fishes attained their present distribution, considering that freshwater habitats are found on landmasses that are separated by open ocean. The central question here is did the ancestors of those groups cross the ocean or was there a freshwater connection between the now separate land masses. To understand this one must first take up the question of what a "freshwater fish" is.</P>
<P>There are two basic types of fishes found in freshwater: <B>euryhaline marine fishes</B> (e.g., bullshark; primarily marine but capable of entering fresh water) and <B>obligatory freshwater fishes</B> (require freshwater at some point in their life cycle. Obligatory freshwater fishes are further divided into <B>saltwater dispersants</B>, capable of dispersing long distances through salt water (e.g., anguillid eels), and <B>freshwater dispersants</B>, incapable of long range dispersal through salt water and therefore dependent on freshwater dispersal routes. Saltwater dispersants may be <B>diadromous</B> fishes (e.g., salmon) or <B>freshwater representatives of marine groups </B>(e.g., freshwater rays). Freshwater dispersants are subdivided into <B>primary</B> and <B>secondary</B> freshwater fishes (the former exclusively freshwater, the latter freshwater and estuarine).</P>
<P>Freshwater fish distributions are subdivided into six zoogeographic regions corresponding mainly to the continental land masses: <B>Ethiopian Region</B> (African continent); <B>Neotropical Region</B> (South and Central America); <B>Oriental Region</B> (Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia, Indonesia, and the Phillipines); <B>Palaearctic Region</B> (Europe and Asia north of the Himalayas; <B>Nearctic Region</B> (North America and the Mexican Plateau); and <B>Austrailian Region</B> (Austrailia, New Guinea and New Zealand).</P>
<P>The Ethiopian Region contains at least 2000 freshwater species, over 95% of which are freshwater dispersants. Ostariophysans (catfishes, cyprinids, and characins) make up 43% of the latter group. Among nonostariophysans are ancient elements such as the endemic mormyrids and polypterids, and the widespread lungfishes and bonytongues. Cichlids are especially diverse in the rift lakes of eastern Africa where they form large species flocks.</P>
<P>The Neotropical region is divided into two subregions: long isolated South America and geologically recent Central America. South America alone has over 2600 species. The dominant groups are catfishes and characins (cyprinids are absent!). Nonostariophysans are a minor component (10%), mostly cichlids, livebearers and killifishes (including orestias and four-eyed fishes). Gymnotiforms are an endemic group of electric catfishes (6 families). Lungfishes and bonytongues (arawanas and arapaimas) are also represented. There are number of diadromous species and endemic freshwater representatives of marine groups (stingrays, anchovies, drums, galaxiids).</P>
<P>The Central American Subregion (including the Carribean) contains about 460 species, 59% of which are freshwater dispersants from North and South America, and the remainder (41%) are euryhaline marine fishes and freshwater representatives of marine groups. Cichlids, livebearers and killifishes dominate the fauna; only 38% of the freshwater dispersants are ostariophysans. The subregion is unstable geologically (recent sea-level changes and volcanic activity) which may account for the success of nonostariophysan groups.</P>
<P>The Oriental Region is dominated by cyprinids and, to a lesser extent, catfishes (Clariids). Nonostariophysans include snakeheads, gouramis, knifefishes and synbranchid eels. The faunas of Southeast Asia and Indonesia include these elements but or otherwise poorly known. The fauna of peninsular India is made up mostly of advanced ostariophysans of Asiatic or African origin.</P>
<P>Freshwater dispersants make up 53% of the fauna of the Palaearctic Region. The dominant groups are the cyprinids and cobitids. Perch, killifish, and esocids are also well represented. Anadromous fishes (mostly salmonids) make up 17% of the fauna, and dominate in arctic drainages. Freshwater representatives of marine groups (e.g., sculpins of Lake Biakal) make up 11% of the fauna, and euryhaline marine species (mostly gobies) make up the remaining 18%.</P>
<P>The Nearctic Region consists of two northern subregions (Atlantic and Pacific) and the Mexican transition zone. There are about 950 native species. Freshwater dispersants make up 77% of the fauna of the northern subregions. The most common families are minnows, percids (perch and darters), suckers, catfishes (Ictaluridae) and sunfishes. Diadromous fishes make up 11% of the fauna (salmon, trout, whitefishes and lampreys). Freshwater representatives of marine groups (e.g., sculpins) make up 6%. The remaining 6% are euryhaline marine species. The Mississippi Province is noteworthy because it is an important refugium for relict groups such as sturgeons, paddlefish, gar, bowfin and relatives of bonytongues.</P>
<P>The Mexican subregion is difficult to characterize because of its transitional nature. Minnows, suckers, ictalurid catfishes, and centrarchids are well represented (mostly in the north), as are poecilids, characins, cichlids and pimelodid catfishes (mostly in the south). The central plateau is an isolated area high in endemism (many endemic goodeids and the atherinid genus <U>Chirostoma</U>).</P>
<P>The Austrailian Region is noted for its long isolation and depauperate primary freshwater fauna (ancient Austrailian lungfish and a bonytongue, the barramundi). The rest of the fauna is made up of diadromus fishes (lampreys, anguillid eels, galaxiids) and representatives of marine families (gobies, silversides, snooks).</P>
<P>Much of freshwater zoogeography deals with explaining the continental distributions of freshwater dispersants, given the vast oceans that presently separate the land masses. The best explanation to date is the theory of plate tectonics and continental drift. </P>
<P>During the Triassic period (200 mya) the continents were united into one giant land mass, Pangea. The distributions of extant groups and the fossil record suggest that the freshwater fish fauna present at that time consisted of lungfishes, crossopterygians, chondrosteans, and freshwater neopterygians (gar, bowfin, bonytongues). </P>
<P>By the end of the Triassic, Pangea split into two land masses: Laurasia and Gondwanaland. Shortly after, Austrailia, Antarctica, Madagascar and India split off of Gondwanaland and thereafter played little role in the evolution of extant freshwater groups.</P>
<P>The ancient Pangean fauna probably dominated both land masses until the Cretaceous period (120 mya) when modern groups began to appear. Early ostariophysans (catfishes and characins) probably evolved on Gondwanaland just before the split of South America and Africa (found in both places today). Following this split South America underwent a long period of isolation which produced the divergent groups of catfishes and characins found there today. </P>
<P>Africa first made contact with Laurasia (late Cretaceous). The family Cyprinidae probably evolved in North Africa in the early Cenozoic (70 mya) and then spread throughout Laurasia and Africa. The modern representatives of the north temperate fauna (minnows, suckers, percids, ictalurids, sunfishes, cobitids, silurids) probably developed during the Cenozoic as North America split from Eurasia. Origin of the ictalurids is a mystery since they don't appear to be closely related to Eurasian catfishes. The hiodontids of North America appear to be closely related to the notopterids of Africa and southeast Asia. They are the only osteoglossoforms, a gondwanaland derived group, distributed in north temperate areas. </P>
<P>The Oriental region was isolated from the rest of Asia by the rise of the Himalayas which was brought about by the collision of India with Asia. The merger brought about a mixing of faunas of the African and Palaearctic regions evident in the Oriental fauna today. </P></BODY>
