<P>No where is the classification on fishes more problematic than in the bony fishes (formerly Class Osteichthyes). As with "fishes" as a whole, treatment of bony fishes as a group independent of tetrapods (land vertebrates), ignores the fact that tetrapods are derived bony fishes and renders bony fishes "paraphyletic" (a group that comprises ancestor but not all of its descendents). With the change to <B>phylogenetic systematics</B> as the primary theory of classification, vertebrate (craniate) classification is changing to be more in line with phylogeny. Thus, Sarcopterygii, the group that gave rise to tetrapods, includes the tetrapods in modern classifications, and the remaining bony fishes (rayfins) are treated as a group equal in rank to Sarcopterygians. In order to discuss bony fishes as a group, we must use the "synthetic approach" and construct a group that reflects a common <B>grade</B> in evolution that vertebrates evolved through before leaving the water. Doing this ignores the pattern of phylogeny and places the emphasis on shared primitive characteristics. The grade we wish to emphasize is that of an aquatic fish-like vertebrate with a skeleton that is ossified or at least part true bone; a skull of many sutured bones (as opposed to a fused mass of cartilage); teeth that are usually fused to the jaws (as opposed to attached by ligaments); a bony operculum covering the gills; soft rays (composed of <B>lepidotrichia</B>) usually segmented and dermal in origin; nasal openings dorsal and usually divided; <B>premaxillae</B> and <B>maxillae</B> (dermal bones) usually form biting edge of upper jaw; lung or swimbladder present (absent in chondrichthyans); intestinal spiral valve present in lower forms; spiracle reduced or absent; fertilization usually external. </P>
<P>Lungs - the air-breathing structures that enabled vertebrates to move out of water - are an ancestral characteristic of bony fishes (suggests tropical, freshwater origin). Lungs are replaced by a hydrostatic organ called the swimbladder in more advanced rayfin fishes. The first lungs were ventral outpocketings of the gut (as seen in Lepidosireniformes). Lungs later moved to a dorsal position with a ventral connection (as in the Austrailian lungfish <I>Neoceratodus</I>) presumably to overcome the rolling tendency in swimming. A dorsal connection (the <B>pneumatic duct, physostomus</B> <B>condition</B>) developed next, then the connection was lost altogether (<B>physoclistic</B> condition).</P>
<P>Teleostomes show increasing occurrence of bone in skin (scales) and skeleton, particularly the skull (secondarily lost in some groups). The lepidotrichia which support the fins are derived from scales.</P>
<P>Earliest fossil teleostomes are from freshwater deposits of the lower Devonian. All of the major groups (subclasses) of sarcopterygians, and the Chondrostei of Class Actinopterygii appeared almost simultaneously.</P>
<P>Fish-like members of class Sarcopterygii have their fins on the ends of fleshy lobes (so-called lobe-fined fishes). The lobes have internal skeletal supports that are believed to be homologous to the limbs of tetrapods. The presence of lungs and fleshy lobate fins presumably enabled these fishes to move about on land, a transitional (amphibious) lifestyle that led to the evolution of amphibians. Another important characteristic for air-breathers is to have nostrils that open into the throat (upper windpipe). These so-called <B>internal nares</B> or <B>choanae</B> enabled the bearers to breath air with taking the mouth out of the water. The scales of sarcopterygians are a heavy armored type with a layer of <B>cosmine</B> (a type of dentine) in the middle. The tail varies from epichordal heterocercal to diphycercal. </P>
<P>Subclass Coelacanthimorpha includes fossil and living coelacanths. This is the most aquatic group of lobefin fishes. In this group the palatoquadrate is separate from the neurocranium and jaw suspension is essentially hyostylic. Also, the skull is divided into distinct anterior and posterior sections by a special bone called the intracranial joint. Other characteristics include internal nares (in some); cosmoid scales; maxillae and premaxillae present; cloaca absent.</P>
<P>The coelacanthiformes is a diverse group comprising over 120 species in 47 genera. Fossil forms come from both marine and freshwater environments. This group includes what was long thought to be the only extant coelacanth, <B><I>Latimeria chalumnae</B></I>, a species that was discovered off the coast of southern Africa in 1938 and later described by J.L.B. Smith in honor of the person who brought the specimen to his attention (Ms. Courtenay Latimer). However, in 1998 a second species of coelacanth was discovered off the coast of Indonesia. Coelacanths ("hollow spine") are deepwater, marine predators. They are ovoviviparous, and their physiology and soft anatomy resembles that of chondrichthyans.</P>
<P>Fossil and living lungfishes (Infraclass Dipnoi) form a group (as yet unnamed) with the extinct Porolepiformes. Infraclass Dipnoi is characterized by internal nares (<B>choanae</B>); heavy <B>cosmoid</B> scales (primitively); palatoquadrate fused to neurocranium (<B>autostylic</B>); spiral valve; cloaca; teeth fused into grinding plates; maxillae, premaxillae lacking; atrium of heart divided by incomplete septum (primitive three-chambered heart).</P>
<P>Extant lung fishes (4 species) exhibit reduced characters when compared to early forms. South American and African forms (Lepidosireniformes) inhabit swamps and are more dependent on lungs than the Austrailian form which inhabits rivers. South American and African lungfishes burrow in mud, are eel-like and have lobefins reduced to filaments. Larvae have external gills. The African lungfish exhibits true estivation (Protopteridae); it metabolizes muscle to survive.</P>
<P>+Subclass Osteolepimorpha is a group of Devonian lobe-fin fishes (<B>rhipidistians</B>) with choanae, branched fin rays, and an intracranial joint that differs somewhat from that seen in coelacanths. It is a matter of debate whether rhipidistians or lungfishes are the ancestors of tetrapods. Rhipidistians show the greatest homology to the earliest amphibians.</P>
<P>Members of Class Actinopterygii (rayfin fishes) represent the main line of bony fish evolution. The group is named for the fact that the fins are attached directly to the body, rather than on the ends of fleshy lobes. Ray-fin fishes show a transition of scale types from a heavy rhombic scale called a ganoid scale, to thin flexible scale type called a "bony-ridge scale". Rayfin fishes lack internal nares, have <B>branchiostegal</B> rays in gill membrane, and a dorsally attached swimbladder (derived from the lung).</P>
<P>Fossil ray-fin fishes date back to the Devonian (freshwater); by the Mississippian (340 mya) they were the dominant group in freshwater and already invading the seas. The Class is divided into two subclasses: Chondrostei (includes Acipenseriformes, Palaeoniscoids and other extinct groups) and Neopterygii (all other actinopterygians).</P>
<P>Members of subclass Chondrostei have heavy, <B>rhombic</B> shaped, ganoid scales, spiracle, heterocercal tail, and a persistent notochord. Chondrosteans reached greatest diversity in Pennsylvanian period (as many as 13 orders recognized). Modern forms placed in orders Acipenserifomes (sturgeons and paddlefishes) and Polypteriformes (bichirs)</P>
<P>Sturgeons (Acipenseridae; 4 genera, 23 species) and paddlefishes (Polyodontidae, 2 species) are a Holarctic group of freshwater and anadromous fishes that inhabit large rivers. Sturgeons feed on invertebrates strained from bottom sediments, paddlefishes are planktivorous.</P>
<P>Bichirs (2 genera, 11 species) are an unusual group, most likely descendants of a tropical freshwater group of palaeoniscoids. Characteristics include lobate pectoral fins; many dorsal finlets; ganoid scales; paired ventrally connected lungs, spiracle, spiral valve intestine, externally gilled larvae. The group inhabits swamps of tropical Africa.</P>
<P>Subclass Neopterygii ("new fins") is a group of modern rayfins that show a number of advancements over the generalized chondrostean condition: the tail is essentially <B>homocercal</B>; scales are a thin, <B>bony-ridge </B>type; vertebrae are completely ossified and there is more bone in the skeleton; the gasbladder functions as a hydrostatic organ; the maxillae and premaxillae are mobile and can protrude; and the fins are more maneuverable (hence the name). </P>
<P>Early neopterygians shared seas with chondrosteans from Triassic to Cretaceous, gradually becoming dominant as a result of their morphological advances.</P>
<P>Neopterygians traditionally divided into holostean (intermediate) and teleostean grades, with holosteans including gars, bowfin and a number of fossil forms with uncertain affinities. Holosteans retain a varying number of primitive chondrostean characteristics. Gars are characterized by rhombic ganoid scales; spiral valve intestine; large vascularized swimbladder (used for air-breathing); small, immobile maxilla; abbreviated heterocercal tail; long snout with sharp teeth. Gars are primarily freshwater, lie-in-wait predators.</P>
<P>The bowin <I>Amia calva </I>is the only living representative of a group that includes a number of fossil forms. The bowfin also has a large functional lung and spiral valve; but differs from gars in having cycloid scales; a homocercal tail; and a distinctive <B>gular</B> plate. Bowfin inhabit freshwater oxbows and swamps, and can survive long periods of drought in mud (physiologically <B>torpid</B> as in lungfishes). Bowfin and a number of extinct holosteans share with teleosts a mobile maxilla and supramaxilla.</P>
<P>One phylogenetic analysis of these fishes (based on shared derived traits) treats gars separately (Division Ginglymodi) and groups bowfins and other holosteans with teleosts (Division Halecostomi). Other evidence suggests that gars and bowfins share a more recent common ancestry than bowfins and teleosts.<FONT FACE="Courier New"> </P></FONT></BODY>
