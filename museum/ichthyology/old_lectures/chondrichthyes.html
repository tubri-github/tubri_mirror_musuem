<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Chondrichthyans (cartilagenous fishes) first appear in the fossil record in the late Silurian and were common by the Devonian, during which time the two main lines (elasmobranchs and holocephalans) were established. Most fossils are from marine deposits, suggesting a marine origin for the group. Classification of Chondrichthyes follows Compagno (1991).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Characteristics of the subclass Elasmobranchii include cartilagenous skeleton (sometimes calcified), 5 to 7 gill openings, spiracle, placoid scales, pelvic claspers in males, fins supported by horny rays called <B>ceratotrichia</B>. Two groups of elasombranchs are recognized at the cohort level: extinct Palaeoselachii and Euselachii, with extinct and living forms.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Palaeoselchian elasmobranchs (Devonian) lacked claspers and anal fins, had broad based paired fins and terminal rather than subterminal mouths. They exhibited a primitive jaw suspension (<B>amphistylic</B>) wherein the upper jaw was firmly attached to the cranium, and their teeth were a primitive <B>cladodont</B> type (<B>cladodont shark and tooth figure</B>).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Euselachians show advanced architecture of the paired fins (basipterygia are present) and show a transition of tooth and jaw suspension types from a primitive cladodont and hybodont types to modern types.&nbsp; Cladodont grade sharks were replaced in Permian times by sharks with a new crushing type of dentition called <B>hybodont</B> dentition, which evolved with the radiation of molluscs. In hybodonts there is a change in jaw suspension from amphistylic to <B>hyostylic</B>, wherein the upper jaw is free from the cranium or only loosely attached. Hybodont grade sharks ultimately gave rise to modern elasmobranch lines (Jurasic).   Campagno (1991) recognizes two groups of Euselachian: †Subcohort  Protoselachii, with three orders of extinct early sharks; and Subcohort Neoselachii, comprising modern sharks and rays.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the most unusual groups of protoselachians were the mostly freshwater sharks of †Order Xenacanthiforms.  These sharks lived from early Devonian to Triassic times. The jaw suspension was amphistylic as in cladoselachians.  However, their teeth were a peculiar reverse cladodont type with two long cusps bordering a small cusp in the middle. The tail was diphycercal and the pectoral fins bore a central axis with radials out to each side.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;Campagno (1991) classifies neoselachians in four superorders. Superorder Galeomorphi contains "typical" pelagic, predatory sharks, including the "maneaters" (Lamniformes: great white, thresher, mako, mackerel, tiger, basking) requiem sharks (Carchariniformes: black and white tips, bull, tiger, blue, cat, hammerheads), carpet sharks (Orectolobiformes: whale, nurse, wobbegongs) and the horn sharks (Heterodondiformes: descendant of hybodonts, functionally amphistylic, known since Jurassic). </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Superorder Squatinomorpha includes only the distinctive angel sharks. Angel sharks appear to be intermediate between sharks and rays: the pectoral fins are braodly expanded but do not attach to the head.  They have two small dorsal fins and lack an anal fin.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Superorder Squalomorphi includes sharks as different in form as the Hexanchiformes (six gilled sharks), the Squaliformes (dogfish sharks), and the Pristiophoriformes (saw sharks). Hexanchiform sharks are also considered remnants of the hybodont grade. They are characterized by 6 or 7 gill openings, persistent notochord, hybodont dentition, and jaw suspension amphistylic or hyostylic. Squaliform sharks lack the anal fin and have spines preceding the two dorsal fins. The group includes a number of small mesopelagic species. Saw sharks resemble sawfishes, but their teeth vary in size and are only weakly attached to the rostrum.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Superorder Rajomorpha or Batoidae includes the bottom-dwelling skates and rays. The group is characterized by ventral gill openings, enlarged pectoral fins that attach to the head, dorsal eyes and spiracle, and no anal fin. Order Rajiformes (skates, four families) is the most speciose group. Characteristics include weak electric organs in the tail, caudal fin usually lacking, and ovovivipary.  Order Rhinobatiformes comprises four families of fishes that resemble skates anteriorly, but are somewhat shark-like in their tail region, giving the body a guitar like appearance (hence the name guitarfishes). Torpedo rays of Order Torpediniforms possess powerful electric organs that are use to stun fish and possibly for navigation. Myliobatiforms (eagle rays and stingrays) have on their slender tails a scale modified into a spine with an associated venom gland. The function is probably defense. Manta rays (Mobulidae), the largest batoids, are adapted for plankton feeding; they have scooplike appendage on either side of the mouth for directing in plankton.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Characteristics of subclass Holocephali include four gill openings covered by an operculum, upper jaw fused to cranium (holostylic), fused platelike teeth, persistent notochord, no scales, and pelvic and head claspers present. Holocephalans have a peculiar shape adapted for deepwater existence. Compagno (1991) subdivides the suclass into two superorders: extinct Paraselachimorphans (iniopterygians and allies); and living Holocephalimorphans. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fossil holocephalans are known as far back as the upper Devonian (bradydonts). There are about 30 living species (chimeras or ratfishes), all of which scavenge or feed on invertebrates. They have a large dorsal spine for defense against predation. Eggs are laid in leathery cases. </P></BODY>
