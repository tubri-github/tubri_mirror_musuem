<B><P>Circulation</P>
</B><P>The circulatory system in fishes consists of a pumping heart and vessels that carry blood first to the gills and then to the rest of the body. The typical fish heart has four chambers (from back to front): <B>sinus venosus</B>, <B>atrium</B>, <B>ventrical</B>, and either a <B>conus arteriosus</B> (elasmobranchs, lobefins, chondrosteans, holosteans) or a <B>bulbous arteriosus</B> (lampreys, teleosts). Lampreys lack a conus; in teleosts it is very reduced, but still functions to prevent backflow into the heart. </P>
<P>The sinus venosus and atrium are simply holding chambers that funnel blood to the main pumping organ, the ventricle. The conus arteriosus (a muscularized chamber with many valves) and bulbus arteriosus (a thin, elastic walled chamber without cardiac muscle) function to dampen pressure extremes produced by the intermittent pumping of the ventricle. When the ventricle contracts the bulbous arteriosus expands to near the size of the full ventricle. The elastic walls of the bulbous then push back, maintaining pressure on the blood. </P>
<P>Hagfishes differ from other fishes in having additional hearts (pumping organs) associated with other parts of the circulatory system (cardinal-head, caudal-tail, portal-liver). </P>
<P>In lungfishes, the heart is partially divided by an incomplete. The right side receives unoxygenated blood from the sinus venosus. The left side receives oxygenated blood from a vein returning from the lungs (pulmonary vein). This blood is shunted to the dorsal aorta via anterior branchial arteries, which bypass the gills. The separate pulmonary and branchial circulations seen in lungfishes is homologous to the "three-chambered" heart of amphibians. </P>
<P>With the exception of lungfishes, fish hearts handle only deoxygenated blood. Blood leaving the heart goes next to the gills via the ventral aorta and afferent branchial arteries. Blood leaves the gills via efferent branchial arteries, which connect to the dorsal aorta. Elasmobranchs have paired branchial arteries supplying the 5 or 6 holobranchs, and the lone hyoidean hemibranch associated with the spiracle. Teleost are similar except that there is no afferent branchial artery leading to the hemibranch (pseudobranch). The dorsal aorta distributes oxygenated blood to the rest of the body.</P>
<P>In agnathans, the dorsal aorta is single and medial except in the cephalic region where it forms a peculiar circle. In most other fishes the dorsal aorta is paired in the branchial region, and unpaired in the trunk and caudal regions, running through the hemal arches of the vertebral column. A caudal vein collects blood from the tail and transports it anteriorly to the kidneys and gonads. Blood leaving the kidneys, gonads, and tail collects in the <B>posterior cardinal vein</B>. An unpaired <B>anterior cardinal veins</B> collects blood from the head. The cardinal veins join to form the <B>common cardinal vein</B> (<B>ducts of Cuvier</B>) which transports blood to the heart via the sinus venosus.</P>
<P>Like other vertebrates, the blood of fishes consists of liquid plasma and formed elements (red and white blood cells). In fishes, blood cells originate from a variety of organs: from tissue surrounding the gut in hagfishes; from fatty tissue dorsal to the nerve cord in lampreys; from tissues associated with the esophagus, gonads, and spleen in elasmobranchs; and from the thymus, kidney and spleen in bony fishes. </P>
<P>Fish red blood cells (RBC) are nucleated and occur in a range of sizes and numbers depending on activity. RBC production changes seasonally. Fish RBC can contain several types of hemoglobin, each adapted to different temperature, pH, or salinity regimes. Some fish have no hemoglobin at all (antarctic icefishes). </P>
<P>Blood-oxygen affinity also varies with environmental conditions. In general, the better oxygenated the water the lower blood-oxygen affinity. Fishes adapted to hypoxic environments tend to have high blood-oxygen affinities and can thus saturate their hemoglobin with oxygen to a high degree even at lower oxygen tensions. Species adapted to well-oxygenated environments tend to have lower blood-oxygen affinities and require high oxygen tensions to saturate their hemoglobin. </P>
<P>Increasing dissolved carbon dioxide and decreasing pH tend to drive oxygen off hemoglobin and into solution in blood plasma where it is free to diffuse into tissues (<B>Bohr shift</B>). In general, the more active the fish the larger the Bohr shift. </P>
<P>Carbon dioxide and pH effects on blood oxygen capacity is termed <B>Root effect</B> (the higher dissolved carbon dioxide, the lower blood-oxygen capacity). Increases in temperature normally decrease blood-oxygen affinity and capacity. The effect is most apparent in stenothermal species.</P>
<P>Most fish are <B>poikilothermic</B>, possessing no physiological means of regulating body temperature. However, a number of continuous swimming species (tunas, mackerel, some sharks) have a countercurrent retial network associated with their red lateral muscle, which extends deep within the fish. Blood traveling into the red muscle is warmed by blood coming out. The end result is that heat produced by the body musculature during swimming is conserved, and higher than ambient body temperature is maintained.</P></BODY>
