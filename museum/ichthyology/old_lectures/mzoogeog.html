<B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><P>Marine Fish Zoogeography</P></B>
<P>On the surface, the sea is a vast, continuous environment that seems to offer few barriers to the movements of saltwater-adapted fishes.  In reality, the distributions of marine fishes are controlled by some of the same sorts of physiographic factors that are important in freshwater (e.g., gradients in depth, temperature, habitat structure).  A number of zoogeographic regions are recognized, although their boundries are not as distinct as those in freshwater.  Continental drift has played an important role in determining distribution patterns, especially those of continental shelf faunas.</P>

<P>The marine ecosystem is divided into two realms, the <B>benthic realm</B> (bottom) and <B>pelagic realm</B> (open sea).  These in turn are subdivided into zones based on temperature, light penetration, and the extent of the continental shelf or slope.  </P>

<P>The benthic realm consists of the <B>continental shelf</B> which extends down to a depth of about 200 meters (m), the continental slope (<B>bathyal zone</B>) down to about 4000 m, and the ocean floor (<B>abyssal</B> and <B>hadal zones</B>).</P>

<P>The continental shelf is a relatively shallow photic zone comprising a splash zone (<B>supralittoral</B>), the intertidal or <B>littoral zone</B> between high and low tides, and the <B>sublittoral zone</B> which extends out to the edge of the shelf.</P>

<P>The sea shore (supralittoral and littoral) may be rocky (erosional) or sandy (depositional).  Fishes in this zone are adapted to withstand strong wave motion - either by clinging (clingfishes, gobies) or hiding (blennies, sculpins) - and extreme temperature and salinity fluctuations when stranded in tide pools. In depositional areas many inshore fishes are adapted for burrowing in the sand (flounders, stargazers).</P>

<P>The richest fish faunas (e.g., those associated with reefs and kelp beds) occur in the upper 50 m of the sublittoral zone (inner sublittoral).  Depending on water clarity, the outer sublittoral can also be a diverse and productive zone.  Many of the worlds greatest fisheries (cods, rockfish, flounder) are centered on the outer shelf.</P>

<P>The upper continental slope extends from 200-1000 m.  It is inhabited by hake, scorpion fishes and lophioid anglers.  The last rays of light disappear at about 1000 meters, the upper boundary of the lower bathyal zone.  Temperatures are low (around 10 C) and there is little water movement.  The food base consists of the remains of pelagic organisms from above.  Fishes here are adapted to feed on whatever they encounter.  They have enlarged eyes and well developed lateralis systems (halibut, hagfish, scorpaenids, eelpouts (zoarchids), squaloid sharks). </P>

<P>Fishes of the lower bathyal (and below) tend to have a chimeriform body plan with enlarged head and long tapering afterbody and tail (e.g., chimeras, grenadiers and notacathids).  This is believed to be the most efficient morphology for swimming and foraging at great depth.</P>

<P>The abyssal zone is cold (2-4 C) and completely dark.  The nutrient base consists of scant materials showered from above.  Fishes here (grenadiers, tripod fishes) have vestigal eyes and sometimes lack pigmentation.  Neuromasts of the lateralis systems are often set out on stalks.  Few fishes are known from the hadal (trench) zone (ophidiids mostly).</P>

<P>The pelagic realm is divided into a <B>neritic zone</B> (water above the continental shelf), and an <B>oceanic zone</B> (open waters beyond the shelf).  The neritic zone is the richest portion of the pelagic realm because of the nutrients that wash in from land.  Except for upwelling areas, much of the open ocean is analogous to desert in terms of productivity.</P>

<P>Oceanic waters are subdivided into four zones: <B>epipelagic</B> zone which extends to the effective limit of light penetration (about 200 m); the <B>mesopelagic</B> zone down to about 1000 m (the absolute light limit); the <B>bathypelagic</B> (aphotic zone) down to 6000 m, and the <B>hadopelagic</B> trench zone.  Pelagic fishes live in the water column and are independent of the sea bottom. </P>

<P>The epipelagic is the warmest and best lighted of the pelagic zones.  About 70 families are represented, including fast swimmers (tunas, mackerel, billfish) and drifters (e.g., molas).  The sargassum weed community is a special littoral demersal assemblage suspended in the epipelagic zone. </P>

<P>Sunlight diminishes and eventually disappears completely in the mesopelagic zone.  Nevertheless, the food base consists of a migratory zooplankton community.  Fishes in this zone tend to be small and equipped with large senative eyes, well developed lateralis system, and photophores (e.g., bristlemouths, latternfishes).</P>

<P>Below the limit of light (bathypelagic and hadopelagic), the sea is dark and cold, food is scarce, and fish populations are sparse.  Fishes in these zones (e.g., gulpers and deepsea anglefishes) lack swimbladders and tend to have soft bodies (weak skeletons) to increase buoyancy.</P>

<B><I><P>Marine Zoogeographic Regions</P>
</B></I>
<P>Marine zoogeographic regions fall in two broad categories: those associated with continental shelves (<B>neritic</B>), and those associated with the open ocean (<B>pelagic</B>).  Each of these categories is divided into broad latitudinal zones based primarily on temperature.  The continental shelves are further divided east and west on the basis of ocean basins.</P>

<I><P>Neritic Zones</P>
</I>
<P>Continental shelf zones are the most important zoogeographic zones for marine fishes, and among them tropical regions support the most fish (40% of all known species).  Four tropical continental regions are recognized: <B>Indopacific</B>, <B>Eastern Pacific</B>, <B>Western Atlantic</B>, and <B>Eastern Atlantic</B>. They are bounded north and south by the 20 degree isotherm and separated by open ocean.</P>
<P>The Indopacific region is the most extensive and far and away the most diverse because of the more or less continuous shelf that runs from Austrailia to the east coast of Africa.  The Western Atlantic region also encompasses a rather broad shelf and fish groups (particularly reef dwellers) converge with those in the Indopacific.</P>

<P>The Eastern Pacific and the Eastern Atlantic regions are limited to narrow bands of coast along South America and Africa, respectively, and are generally less diverse due to a paucity of islands and reefs.  Interestingly, each shares a number of species with the region on the opposite continental coast, but for different reasons.  The Eastern Pacific and Western Atlantic share species because of connections between these seas before the uplift of the isthmus of Panama.  The Eastern Atlantic and (eastern) Indopacific share species because of movement of species around the tip of Africa.</P>

<P>Four temperate regions are recognized north of the tropics (<B>North Temperate Regions</B>): the <B>Mediterranian-Atlantic</B>, the <B>Asian-Pacific</B>, the <B>North American Atlantic</B>, and the <B>North American Pacific</B>.  Three <B>South Temperate Regions</B> are recognized: the <B>South American</B>, the <B>South African</B>, and the <B>Austrailian</B>. The fish faunas of these regions are less diverse than in the tropics but include species with large populations.</P>

<B><P>Arctic</B> and <B>Antarctic</B> regions are also distinguished on the basis of unique cold-adapted faunas (e.g., cods, eelpouts).  The Arctic region links the faunas of surrounding continents and includes many <B>circumpolar</B> species.  The Antarctic region shares few species with south temperate regions, but many genera and families, indicating a more distant connection.</P>

<I><P>Pelagic Zones</P>
</I>
<P>Pelagic fishes are not bound to the continents and many of the species tend to have worldwide (<B>circumglobal</B>) distributions.  Pelagic regions are thus latitudinal belts that encircle the globe.  <B>Arctic</B>, <B>Subarctic</B>, <B>Temperate</B>, <B>Subtropical</B>, <B>Tropical</B> and <B>Antarctic</B> regions are recognized.  These regions include epipelagic and mesopelagic layers.</P>

<P>The deepsea is divided into <B>bathypelagic</B> and <B>deepsea benthic </B>regions, the former tending to conform to pelagic divisions and the latter tending to conform to continental divisions.</P>

<P>A pattern common to many families, genera and species (e.g., hagfishes, cods, skates) is distribution north and south of the tropics (<B>antitropical distribution</B>).  Species with antitropical distributions tend to be epipelagic.  Shallow water and bottom oriented forms typically show the pattern at the generic and family level, indicating more ancient causal mechanisms.  Four theories proposed to explain the pattern: 1) lower temperatures in the tropics in the past support movement of subtropical and temperate species; 2) movement under the warm surface waters; 3) competitive exclusion of tropical ancestors; and 4) continental drift.           </P>
