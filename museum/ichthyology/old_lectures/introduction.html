<B><P>INTRODUCTION</P>
</B><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>What is a fish?</P>
<P>Term applied to everything caught in net, or by hook, or even dredged from the bottom in some instances (oysters, shrimp, coelenterates, echinoderms, aquatic mammals).</P>
<P>Anatomical definition: fish are cold-blooded animals with backbone, gills and fins. But there are exceptions: tunas, mackerels and some sharks maintain higher than ambient internal temperature; cannot be considered cold-blooded. Some fishes have lungs and breathe air.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, when you think of a fish you think of an organism with a certain shape and characteristics <B>(carp figure)</B>.</P>
<P>Fish live in water and their basic design reflects constraints imposed by an aquatic medium. Water is 800 times as dense as air; it provides so much support that little energy needed to counteract the force of gravity. Most fish are neutrally buoyant in water. </P>
<P>Water is virtually incompressible, literally has to be pushed out of the way (air compresses, makes room). Most fish are streamlined or <B>fusiform</B> in shape; allows them to slice through water; have structural features designed to reduce drag and turbulence (e.g., fins, scales). Movement accomplished by pushing fins and body against the water column for propulsion.</P>
<P>Phylogenetic definition: fish are vertebrates (craniates) that occupy a phylogenetic position between cephalochordates (lancelets) and amphibians. Fish are believed to have evolved from a protochordate similar to <U>Amphioxis</U>, and to have given rise to amphibians and, thereby, higher vertebrates.</P>
<P>Three groups of living fishes recognized:</P>
<P>Agnathans - jawless fishes</P>
<P>Chondrichthyans - cartilagenous fishes</P>
<P>Teleostomes (Osteichthyans) - bony fishes </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Considered as a group, fishes constitute a <B>paraphyletic</B> assemblage; a group is composed of at least three separate lineages which share common ancestry with other vertebrates <B>(vertebrate phylogeny figure)</B>:</P>

<OL>

</B><LI>Diversity of living fishes exceeds 25,000 species. Some estimates put the number of species at about 50,000. Half of all vertebrates are fishes. </LI>
<LI>Existed on planet for at least 500 million years.</LI>
<LI>Smallest fish is dwarf pygmy goby from Philippines which breeds at less that 15 mm; largest fish is whale shark which reaches 21 m.</LI>
<LI>Vertical distribution exceeds 15,000 m, from 5 km above sea level to 11 km below. </LI></OL>

<P>&nbsp;<B>Some useful notes on Systematics and Classification</P>
</B><P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Classification</B> is the practice of arranging objects of study (e.g., fishes) into groups and is also the term given to the arrangement that results.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The groups in a classification are natural biological entities (<B>taxa</B>). <B>Taxonomy</B> is the practice of determining what the entities are. <B>Systematics</B> is the methodology of establishing taxonomy and for determining relationships among taxa.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Biological classification is a hierarchical system with taxa arranged at a number of different levels (e.g., class, order, family, genus, species) to show how the various groups relate to one another. Most taxonomists favor "evolutionary" classification schemes which show how taxa evolved (geneology or phylogenetic history).</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Three methods of classifying organisms have emerged. The first, called the <B>phenetic</B> approach, is based on the methods of <B>numerical taxonomy </B>and emphasizes overall similarity of the taxa under consideration. The second method, called <B>Evolutionary Systematics</B> and sometimes referred to as the <B>"synthetic approach"</B>, emphasizes grades of evolution or degrees of genetic divergenge. The third, and currently favored, method is called <B>Phylogenetic Systematics</B> or the <B>"cladistic approach"</B>.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The cladistic method emphasizes branching patterns or clades. Taxa are recognized on the basis of shared derived characteristics which show how one group (the derived or <B>apomorphic</B> group) split away from other (ancestral or pliesiomorphic) groups.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Early classifications of fishes were Evolutionary classifications. They depicted evolutionary relationships of fishes based on knowledge of vertebrate phylogeny, but formed groups on the basis of perceived degrees of (genetic) similarity. Thus, agnathans, chondrichthyans, and teleostomes were grouped together as fishes (grade Pisces) - separate from the other vertebrate groups (tetrapods) they gave rise to - because all conform to a similar aquatic-adapted morphology. The taxon Pisces includes at least four independently evolving and presumably <B>monophyletic</B> lines of vertebrates, and thus, as a group, is <B>polyphyletic</B>. Moreover, Pisces is <B>paraphyletic</B> because it excludes forms thought to be derived from it, namely the tetrapods.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>In a cladistic classification, all taxa are <B>monophyletic</B> (share same common ancestor) and <B>holophyletic </B>(comprise all descendants). Thus, "Fishes" would not be a valid taxonomic group., Rather, jawless vertebrates would comprise a group distinguishable from other vertebrates by the absence of jaws. All jawed vertebrates (gnathostomes) comprise a group equal in rank to jawless fishes. Vertebrates with bony skeletons (body fishes and tetrapods) would comprise a group distinguishable by the presence of cellular bone in the endoskeleton. This classification is an exact reflection of vertebrate phylogeny, and the groups are natural, sharing suites traits because of common phylogenetic history, with no consideration is given to the ancestral morphological traits shared by agnathans, chondricthyans and teleostomes. &#9;</P></BODY>
