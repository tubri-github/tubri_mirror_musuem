<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fishes - and all other vertebrates - are believed to have evolved from protochordates, specifically from a <B>neotenic</B> organism resembling the free-swimming stage of a tunicate. Tunicates and lancelets share with vertebrates a dorsal hollow nerve cord, pharyngeal gill slits, a notocord and a post anal tail.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;The earliest fishes were jawless (agnathose), armored forms commonly referred to as <B>ostracoderms</B>. The fossil record of ostracoderms dates back 500 million years to the Cambrian Period (marine deposits).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;By the Silurian period ostracoderms underwent an extensive adaptive radiation and invaded freshwater. They were the dominant vertebrates until the middle Devonian. Two distinct lines are evident, one of which (Cephalaspidomorphi) gave rise to modern lampreys.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;Ostracoderms were small fishes (usually less than 15 cm), with no jaws or paired fins, bony armor covering most of the body, a cartilagenous endoskeleton, and a <B>heterocercal</B> tail. They were probably bottom dwelling fishes that used their pharyngeal gills slits for both filter feeding and gas exchange. Later forms evolved "fin-like" stabilizers in the "pectoral region", which may have improved their swimming (<B>ostracoderm figure</B>).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;The two groups of living agnathans (lampreys and hagfishes), although similar in appearence (eel-like), are thought to be very distantly related (different classes of vertebrates). Like ostracoderms, they lack jaws and paired fins, have cartilagenous skeletons, one or two semicircular canals, and a single medial nostril. (<B>living jawless fishes figure</B>)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;Hagfishes have a ventral mouth surrounded by tactile barbels, a tongue with keritinized teeth, rudimentary eyes, 1 to 14 gill openings, and numerous slime pores lining the body. The group is entirely marine and comprises 40 species in six genera (2 families). Hagfishes are found mainly in cool temperate waters at depths exceeding 25 meters. They feed on invertebrates in soft oceans bottoms and scavenge on fish. They secrete large amounts of mucous to render themselves and their prey unpalatable to predators and competitors. A peculiar knotting behavior allows them to rid their bodies of excess mucus and to gain leverage in feeding. Females lay small numbers of large, leathery eggs with hooks for attaching to the bottom.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Lampreys have a large sucking disk (as adults) with many rows of keritinized toothlike plates used for rasping holes in other fish. Adults typically migrate long distances up freshwater streams from the sea for breeding purposes (<B>anadromous</B>). In some species the adult stage in nonmigratory and nonpredatory. Lampreys breed over nests constructed in shallow gravel riffles. Eggs develop into larvae called <B>ammocoetes</B> which exhibit the primitive basket feeding morphology and live as filter feeders buried in sediment. Ammocoetes metamorphose into adults after 3-7 years. (<B>Lamprey life history figure</B>) </P></BODY>
