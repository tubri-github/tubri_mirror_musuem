<P>Teleosts are by far the most diverse group of fishes with over 20,0000 species by some estimates (95% of all extant fishes). There are 38 recognized orders, 425 families and 4070 genera. They are distinguished from other neopterygians by important changes in the upper jaw (mobile premaxilla), the caudal skeleton (symmetry of the tail) and in the use of the gasbladder. Division teleostei is divided into four subdivisions: Osteoglossomorpha; Elopomorpha; Clupeomorpha; and Euteleostei.&#9;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Subdivision Osteoglossomorpha is probably the most primitive of the four subdivisions of teleostian fishes. Characters uniting members of the group include presence of teeth on the tongue and on the roof of the mouth (forms biting apparatus), caudal fin with 16 or fewer branched rays, intermuscular bones absent, cycloid scales. Oldest known members date back to the Jurrasic. Osteoglossomorphs may have dominated freshwater faunas prior to the emergence of ostariophysans, the dominant group at present. The group comprises a single order, four families and 200+ species of freshwater fishes, most in the African family Mormyridae.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Family Osteoglossidae (bonytongues) is the oldest and most widespread family in the order (6 species in tropics of Africa, South America, Asia and Austrailia). Bonytongues are characterized by elongate bodies covered with large scales, and lunglike swimbladders. Amazon River species, arapaima, is one of the largest fishes in freshwater (up to 3 m). </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Family Hiodontidae (mooneyes) is characterized by bright gold or silver eyes adapted for night vision. The group includes 2 species common in backwaters of large rivers of North America.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Family Notopteridae (knifefishes) includes 6 species from tropical Asia and Africa. The group is characterized by long, strongly compressed, tapered bodies, long anal fins, and reduced or absent dorsal and pelvic fins. Knifefishes live among vegetation in backwaters subject to stagnation (swimbladder adapted for air breathing).</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Family Pantodontidae includes only the small, butterfly fish of central Africa. It lives near the surface and uses its elongate pectorals for gliding and support in shallow water.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Family Mormyridae (elephantfishes) is a diverse group of fishes adapted for nocturnal existence in lakes and rivers of tropical Africa. They have well-developed electric organs which they use for navigation and communication. Many species have proboscis-like snouts on lower jaws for probing bottom sediments. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Family Gymnarchidae includes a single species (<U>Gymnarchus</U> <U>niloticus</U>) related to mormyrids. Characteristics of include long eel-like body, large electric organ, long dorsal fin, and no anal, caudal or pelvic fins. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Elopomorphs and Clupeomorphs are believed to represent two separate evolutionary lineages, despite superficial resemblances between some of the forms.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Fishes in the subdivision Elopomorpha all share in common transparent, planktonic, <B>leptocephalus</B> larvae. The group is mostly marine, dates back to the Jurassic comprises 4 orders, 25 families and about 630 species.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Elopiformes are pelagic fishes that resemble herrings except that the body is elongate and slender, and a gular plate is present. The order comprises 2 families and 7 species of primarily marine fishes that are among the most prized sport fish.  Included are two species of tarpon (<I>Megalops</I>) and 5 species of  ladyfishes (genus <I>Elops</I>) </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Albuliformes comprises near shore and deep sea bonefishes (suborder Albuloidei), and deepwater halosaurs and spiny eels (suborder Notacanthoidei).  Near shore bonefishes are prized sport fish.  Halosaurs and spiny eels are deep water eels characterized by an elongate anal fin that is continuous with the tail, dorsal fin typically reduced to a series of spines, and both pelvic and pectoral fins present. There are 25 species with a depth range of 100-5000 m. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Order Anguilliformes is a diverse group (19 families, 600 species) of primarily marine, bottom-dwelling, eel-like fishes characterized by elongate bodies with continuous dorsal, caudal and anal fins, no pelvic fins and reduced gill openings.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Suborder Anguilloidei includes most eel families (typical eels). Gill openings are far back of the head and covered by a small operculum. The best known are the freshwater eels of the family Anguillidae. Freshwater eels are actually <B>catadromous</B>, i.e., they develop and mature in freshwater and estuarine habitats, but migrate offshore for spawning.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Suborder Muraenoidei includes the reef-dwelling moray eels, which lack pectoral fins, have laterally compressed bodies and scales, and have the nostrils set high on the head. Moray eels are fierce predators with sharp daggerlike teeth. They are implicated in "ciguatera" a form of fish poisoning.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Conger eels (suborder Congroidei) are marine eels that resemble morays except that their teeth are stout and cone-shaped and they have pectoral fins. They live in shallow coastal seas among rocks or burrowed in soft bottoms.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Family Ophichthyidae (snake eels) includes about 240 species of actively burrowing eels characterized by a well developed branchial pumping apparatus and both pair of nostrils on tip of snout. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Order Saccopharyngiformes is a strange group of deepwater eels with very large mouths, capacious stomach, and greatly reduced jaw, suspensorium, and branchial skeleton to accommodate large prey. Some species have biolumnescent organs on their tails.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The characteristics that unite clupeomorphs - silvery scales, compressed, keeled body, fine gillrakers - represent adaptations to a pelagic, planktivorous lifestyle. Clupeomorphs also have an acute sense of hearing produced by an extension of the swimbladder which connects to the inner ear.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Order Clupeiformes includes 4 families and about 330 species of primarily anadromous, schooling fishes (many commercially important). Members of family Clupeidae (herring, shad, sardines, menhaden) typically have deep bodies with strongly keeled, sawtoothed venters. Anchovies (family Engraulidae) are smaller, narrow-bodied forms with overhanging snout and long jaws.</P>
