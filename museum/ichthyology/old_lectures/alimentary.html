<B><P>Alimentary Canal and Feeding</P>
</B><P>The alimentary canal in fishes consists of the gut tube and all derived structures associated with feeding (excluding gills, gill arches and the swimbladder). Features of the alimentary canal in fishes vary according to group and generalized feeding mode. Five generalized feeding modes are recognized.</P>
<B><P>Predators/Piscivores</B> feed on relatively large animals (e.g., other fish); they usually have well-developed teeth for grasping and holding prey, acid-secreting stomachs, and relatively short intestines. </P>
<B><P>Grazers</B> take stationary food (e.g., plants, mussels, coral) in bites. They have teeth or jaws adapted for scraping and mashing. </P>
<B><P>Strainers</B> are primarily plankton feeders (planktivores) with the inside edges of the gill arches modified into a filtering apparatus (<B>gill rakers</B>). </P>
<B><P>Suction feeders</B> (e.g., sturgeon, suckers) typically have rounded, inferior mouths with thick, fleshy lips. In some groups the suctorial mouth functions as a holdfast (Loricariidae) in fast water. The jawless, suctorial mouths of lampreys have rasping teeth for boring holes in fish.</P>
<B><P>Tubefeeders </B>(trumpetfishes, pipefishes and butterfly fishes) have tube-shaped mouths for sucking in small food items or feeding in small crevices. Some predators (e.g., mojarras) can extend their mouths into a tube for sucking in prey at short distances.</P>
<P>Three types of teeth are recognized based on location: <B>jaw</B>, <B>mouth</B> and <B>pharyngeal</B>. Jaw teeth are found on the maxillary and premaxillary bones above (maxillary is toothless in spiny-rayed fishes), and the dentaries below. Mouth teeth are variously borne on the vomer, palatine, parasphenoid, and pterygoid bones in the roof of the mouth, and on the tongue (glossohyal) and basibranchial in the floor of the mouth. Pharyngeal teeth occur as pads on upper and lower elements of various gill arches.</P>
<P>Several forms of teeth are recognized. <B>Cardiform</B> teeth are short, fine, pointed teeth that occur in dense pads (catfishes). <B>Villiform</B> teeth are elongate cardiform type resembling intestinal villi (needlefishes). <B>Canines</B> are long fang-like teeth adapted for piercing and holding (walleyes). <B>Incisors</B> are chisel-edged cutting teeth (porgies) that are sometimes fused into a beak (parrotfishes). <B>Molariform</B> teeth are flattened, crushing and grinding teeth as seen in some rays.</P>
<P>In general planktivores and periphyton scrapers have toothless jaws, although the jaw itself may be modified into a scraping device in the latter. Fishes that feed on shelled invertebrates typically have crushing molariform teeth. Carnivorous fishes that feed on prey larger than themselves either have piercing canines or razor sharp, cutting teeth (e.g., piranahs).</P>
<P>The inside surfaces of gill arches bear structures called <B>gill rakers</B>, which function to keep the gills free of food. Gill raker morphology varies with feeding mode. Plankton feeders have numerous elongate rakers for trapping plankton. More omnivorous feeders have short, stubby gill rakers.</P>
<P>Modifications of the digestive tube include dispensable esophagus and stomach for swallowing large prey (e.g., gulper eels), gizzard-like grinding stomachs (gizzard shad), adaptations for increasing intestinal absorptive surface (villi, spiral valve and typhlosole), and adaptations for taking in air or water into the stomach for respiration (armored catfishes) or inflating the body (puffers). </P>
<P>Carnivorous fishes typically have well developed stomachs and relatively short intestines. Herbivores typically have reduced stomachs and long, coiled intestines, usually with endo-commensal bacteria capable of digesting cellulose. Omnivores typically have intermediate sac-shaped stomachs. Many fishes with accessory structures for trituration and grinding of food lack stomachs altogether. </P>
<B><P>Pyloric cecae</B> are fingerlike pouches that extend outward from the gut between the stomach and intestine. They have been found to secrete enzymes important in fat and sugar digestion. The liver plays an important role in fat digestion, fat and glycogen storage, and blood cleansing. It is large and bilobed in primitive fishes (sharks). The gall bladder is a temporary storage organ for secretions of the liver, which function to neutralize stomach acid and emulsify fat. The pancreas is a discrete organ in elasmobranchs and primitive bony fish, but it is diffuse in higher fishes and intertwined with the liver (<B>hepatopancreas</B>). The pancreas produces enzymes important in digestion. </P>
<P>Sharks, rays and lungfishes possess a cloaca, the posterior most chamber of the digestive tract that receives both feces and urogenital products. In all other fishes, the digestive and urogenital systems have separate outlets. </P></BODY>
