<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Members of Class Actinopterygii (rayfin fishes) represent the main line of bony fish evolution. The group is named for the fact that the fins are attached directly to the body, rather than on the ends of fleshy lobes. Ray-fin fishes show a transition of scale types from a heavy rhombic scale called a ganoid scale, to thin flexible scale type called a "bony-ridge scale". Rayfin fishes lack internal nares, have <B>branchiostegal</B> rays in gill membrane, and a dorsally attached swimbladder (derived from the lung).</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Fossil ray-fin fishes date back to the Devonian (freshwater); by the Mississippian (340 mya) they were the dominant group in freshwater and already invading the seas. The Class is divided into two subclasses: Chondrostei (includes Acipenseriformes, Palaeoniscoids and other extinct groups) and Neopterygii (all other actinopterygians).</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Members of subclass Chondrostei have heavy, <B>rhombic</B> shaped, ganoid scales, spiracle, heterocercal tail, and a persistent notochord. Chondrosteans reached greatest diversity in Pennsylvanian period (as many as 13 orders recognized). Modern forms placed in orders Acipenserifomes (sturgeons and paddlefishes) and Polypteriformes (bichirs)</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Sturgeons (Acipenseridae; 4 genera, 23 species) and paddlefishes (Polyodontidae, 2 species) are a Holarctic group of freshwater and anadromous fishes that inhabit large rivers. Sturgeons feed on invertebrates strained from bottom sediments, paddlefishes are planktivorous.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Bichirs (2 genera, 11 species) are an unusual group, most likely descendants of a tropical freshwater group of palaeoniscoids. Characteristics include lobate pectoral fins; many dorsal finlets; ganoid scales; paired ventrally connected lungs, spiracle, spiral valve intestine, externally gilled larvae. The group inhabits swamps of tropical Africa.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Subclass Neopterygii ("new fins") is a group of modern rayfins that show a number of advancements over the generalized chondrostean condition: the tail is essentially <B>homocercal</B>; scales are a thin, <B>bony-ridge </B>type; vertebrae are completely ossified and there is more bone in the skeleton; the gasbladder functions as a hydrostatic organ; the maxillae and premaxillae are mobile and can protrude; and the fins are more maneuverable (hence the name). </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Early neopterygians shared seas with chondrosteans from Triassic to Cretaceous, gradually becoming dominant as a result of their morphological advances.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Subclass Neopterygii was traditionally divided into holostean (intermediate) and teleostean grades, with holosteans including gars, bowfin and a number of fossil forms with uncertain affinities. Holosteans retain a varying number of primitive chondrostean characteristics. Gars are characterized by rhombic ganoid scales; spiral valve intestine; large vascularized swimbladder (used for air-breathing); small, immobile maxilla; abbreviated heterocercal tail; long snout with sharp teeth. Gars are primarily freshwater, lie-in-wait predators.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The bowin <I>Amia calva </I>is the only living representative of a group that includes a number of fossil forms. The bowfin also has a large functional lung and spiral valve; but differs from gars in having cycloid scales; a homocercal tail; and a distinctive <B>gular</B> plate. Bowfin inhabit freshwater oxbows and swamps, and can survive long periods of drought in mud (physiologically <B>torpid</B> as in lungfishes). Bowfin and a number of extinct holosteans share with teleosts a mobile maxilla and supramaxilla.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>One phylogenetic analysis of these fishes (based on shared derived traits) treats gars separately (Division Ginglymodi) and groups bowfins and other holosteans with teleosts (Division Halecostomi). Other evidence suggests that gars and bowfins share a more recent common ancestry than bowfins and teleosts.</P></BODY>
