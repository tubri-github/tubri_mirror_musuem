<B><P>Respiration and Buoyancy</P>
</B><P>The concentration of oxygen in water is very low compared to that in air (1 to 8 ml/liter verses 210 ml/liter, respectively). Most fishes use high surface area, highly vascularized gills to extract necessary oxygen from water. The gills are ventilated by a unidirectional flow of water created either by forward swimming movements with mouth open (<B>ram ventilation</B>) or branchial pumping.</P>
<P>In agnathans, the gills are situated in pouches that open into the pharynx and to the outside through pores. In gnathostomes, the gills are filamentous and borne on interbranchial septa of the gill arches. Elasmobranchs have plate-like gills separated by elongate septa. In bony fishes, the septa are reduced and the gill filaments are long and symmetrical.</P>
<P>Elasmobranchs and primitive bony fish retain a functional hyoidean hemibranch. In teleosts the hemibranch degenerates into a <B>pseudobranch</B>, which receives only oxygenated blood and may be involved in the function of the choroid rete of the eye. </P>
<P>Gill filaments are composed of numerous thin folds called <B>lamellae</B>, which are the actual sites of gas exchange. Capillaries in the lamellae channel blood in the opposite direction of the flow of water over the gill filaments. This <B>countercurrent exchange</B> maximizes gas exchange efficiency (as high as 80%). A portion of the blood flow in gills may be nonrespiratory (in venolymphatic sinuses) depending on oxygen demand.</P>
<P>In most bony fishes, gills are ventilated by synchronous contractions of the buccal and opercular cavities. The rate of gas exchange is influenced by both the rate of contraction and the ventilation volume (both increase with hypoxic stress). Some gas exchange does take place across the skin, particularly in larval fishes and scaleless fishes (<B>aquatic cutaneous respiration</B>).</P>
<P>Some fishes orient toward the water surface to deal with hypoxic conditions. Others actually breathe air through true lungs (lungfishes), or modifications of the gills (<I>Clarius</I>), mouth (electric eels), gut (armored catfihes), swimbladder (gars) or skin (<I>Anguilla</I>).</P>
<P>A variety of buoyancy mechanisms have evolved in fishes to reduce the energetic cost of maintaining position in the water column. The principal means is through use of the swimbladder, a modified lung. Others include incorporation of low-density compounds (lipids) into the body (sharks, few teleosts), retention of body fluids in marine fish (1/3 salt of seawater), and reduction of heavy tissues such as bone and muscle (demersal fishes).</P>
<P>The advantage of using the gasbladder is that buoyancy can be regulated. Gasbladders are of two basic types: physostomus with a connection to the gut via the <B>pneumatic duct</B>) and physoclistic (no connection).</P>
<P>Physostomes inflate their swimbladders by gulping air at the surface and forcing it through the pneumatic duct; they deflate the bladder through the mouth by a reflex called the <B>gasspuckreflex</B> ("gas-spitting reflex") or through a special opening behind the anus in herrings. The need to gulp air restricts obligate physostomes to relatively shallow water because neutral buoyancy at greater depths requires additional inflation of the bladder (gas compresses 1 atmosphere for each 10 meters of depth).</P>
<P>Many fishes have special circulatory adaptations for inflating and deflating the gasbladder (permits buoyancy at greater depths). Inflation gases are supplied by a structure called the <B>rete mirabile</B>, a tight bundle of afferent and efferent capillaries that run parallel to each other in close proximity and work on a countercurrent exchange principal. A special gland called the <B>gas gland</B> situated at the lumen end of the rete in the wall of the gasbladder secretes lactic acid. The acid conditions drive oxygen off hemoglobin (Bohr shift and Root effect) and other gases out of solution in the blood plasma on the efferent side of the rete. The increased gas tension on the efferent side causes gas to diffuse to afferent capillaries where they multiply until the tension of gases in the blood exceeds the gas tension in the bladder. The longer the retial capillaries (e.g., deepwater species), the more efficient the gas-multiplication process.</P>
<P>Deflation of the bladder occurs at a separate richly vascularized area called the <B>oval</B>. Capillaries of the oval resorb gas from the bladder depending on the tension of gas in the bladder and the extent of exposure of the capillaries to the bladder. Resorption is controlled by a sphincter in the bladder wall or by muscles in the capillaries which restrict the flow of blood to the capillaries and the exposure of the capillaries to the bladder. The resorptive area is typically in a different region of the bladder from the gas secreting area, and frequently separated by a membrane.</P>
<P>Possession and use of a swimbladder presents problems for many mesopelagic species, which migrate over great vertical distances (as much as 500 meters). In these instances, there is either greater elaboration of the gas secreting and resorbing capillaries or the swimbladder is reduced and/or invested with fat. </P></BODY>
