<B><P>Excretion and Osmoregulation</P>
</B><P>The primary organ of excretion and osmoregulation in fishes is the kidney, although other organs are involved in hydromineral balance and elimination of metabolic (primarily nitrogenous) wastes. </P>
<P>Hydrogen ions and bicarbonate produced as a result of hydration of metobolically generalted carbon dioxide are buffered in the blood until excreted (usually in exchange for Na+ and Cl-).</P>
<P>Fish kidneys are elongate structures that run the length of the dorsal body wall behind the peritoneum. There are distinct anterior and posterior sections, with excretory function concentrated in the latter. Function of the anterior section varies: in elasmobranchs and primitive bony fishes it is involved in reproduction; in most teleosts it is involved primarily in blood cell formation. </P>
<P>As in other vertebrates, the structural unit of the typical fish kidney is the nephron, consisting of a tightly coiled portal system (<B>glomerulus</B>), a surrounding capsule for collecting the blood filtrate (<B>Bowman's capsule</B>), and a convoluted tubule, through which certain substances are either secreted or reabsorbed, and the remaining filtrate is transported to the exterior. Nephron structure and function varies in different fish groups depending on the need for osmoregulation.</P>
<P>The typical kidney in most fishes is called an <B>opisthonephros</B>. A primitive <B>pronephros</B> is seen in embryonic development and is retained in modified form as the <B>head kidney</B> in many groups. The anterior "pronephric" kidney has segmentally arranged tubules and ciliated funnels called <B>nephrostomes</B> that connect to the pericardial and body cavities. The pronephros is functional only in hagfishes and larval lampreys. The posterior kidney in both opithonephrous and pronephrous fishes is also called a <B>mesonephros</B>.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>In female elasmobranchs the anterior kidney is reduced, whereas in males it is enlarged and functions as part of the genital system. In primitive bony fishes the head kidney is similarly involved in reproduction. In teleosts the head kidney is  variously connected to the mesonephros.</P>
<P>In addition to excretion of metabolic wastes, the kidney plays an important function in hydro-mineral balance. How a fish balances water and salt depends on the concentration of salt in its tissues and in the external environment. &#9;</P>
<P>The concentration of salts in the body fluids of hagfishes is similar to that of seawater and they have little water or ion regulating ability (<B>osmoconformers</B>). In most other fishes internal salt concentrations are roughly 1/3 that of seawater. Marine elasmobranchs (and the coelacanth) retain organic salts (primarily urea and trimethylamineoxide or TMAO) in their tissues and thereby achieve a total osmotic concentration close to that of seawater. A special gland called the <B>rectal gland</B> secretes excess salt (Na+ and Cl-) taken in the diet. Freshwater elasmobranchs retain less urea and TMAO, thus reducing their internal osmotic concentration. </P>
<P>Fishes in freshwater (teleosts and lampreys) are <B>hyperosmotic</B> in relation to their environment; their tissues continually gain water by inward diffusion. Scales, skin and mucus help to retard inward diffusion of water, but water diffuses readily at the gills and mucosa of the mouth. Freshwater teleosts have well-developed kidneys which produce dilute urine (ammonia) in large quantities. Salts lost in urine production and by passive diffusion through the gills are actively recovered through special <B>chloride cells</B> in the gills.</P>
<P>Marine teleosts are hyposmotic and thus continually lose water to their environment by passive diffusion. They have regressive kidneys and replace lost water by drinking seawater and actively secreting salt through chloride cells at the gills.</P>
<P>Euryhaline fishes exhibit the greatest versatility in dealing with salinity changes; osmoregulatory costs are balanced against life history gains. The basic approaches to osmoregulation are basically the same: in high salt environments euryhaline fishes increase osmoconcentration by drinking seawater, reducing urine flow, and secreting excess salt; in low salt environments they reduce osmoconcentration by increasing urine flow and taking up salt. The difference is the changes occur more or less rapidly depending on how quickly these fishes transit different salinity regimes. Diadromous fishes typically undergo gradual shifts in ion regulatory ability as they develop through different life stages.</P>
<P>Because freshwater fishes have a higher than ambient internal salt concentration they are in no danger of freezing unless their environment freezes. However, marine teleosts can freeze when the water around them is still liquid, because their lower than ambient internal salt concentration is associated with a higher freezing-point temperature. Fishes adapted to the coldest marine environments (e.g., antarctic icefishes) have large glycoproteins in their blood, which act as antifreeze agents, disrupting ice crystal formation.<FONT FACE="Courier New"> </P></FONT></BODY>
