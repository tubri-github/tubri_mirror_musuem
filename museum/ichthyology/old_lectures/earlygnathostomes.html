<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A limited array of feeding modes is possible with a jawless mouth, and otracoderms may have exhausted the possibilities. Some of the later forms evolved moveable plates around the mouth, and the modern descendants are scavengers, parasitic or nonfeeding. Evolution of jaws permitted a switch from filter feeding to a predatory lifestyle. First evidence of jaws dates back to the upper Silurian period (400 mya). All jawed vertebrates assigned to the superclass <B>Gnathostomata</B>.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Jaws are believed to have arisen from structures that support gills in primitive jawless fishes (<B>visceral arches</B>). Early ostracoderms had as many as 10 visceral arches. The first two were apparently lost, while the third and fourth arches formed the jaws and their supporting mechanism. The third visceral arch (the <B>mandibular arch</B>) formed both the upper (<B>palatoquadrate cartilage</B>) and lower (<B>Meckel's cartilage</B>) jaws. The fourth arch (<B>hyoid arch</B>) formed the <B>hyoid apparatus</B>: the upper portion of which (<B>hyomandibular cartilage</B>) is fused to the cranium and forms the jaw suspensorium; and the lower portion of which (<B>ceratohyal cartilage</B>) supports the tongue apparatus. The gill slit between the mandibular and hyoid arches is reduced to a small opening called the spiracle in primitive gnathostomes and is later lost altogether. The remaining visceral arches (including the fourth) continued to support gills. (<B>Jaw evolution figure</B>)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several lines of evidence support the origin of jaws from gill arches. First, the jaws are in series with the branchial arches behind them. Second, there is embryological evidence that jaws come from gill arches. Third, branches of the fifth cranial nerve (trigeminal) serve the jaws in a manner identical to that in which other cranial nerves serve gill arches: one branch runs forward and one runs behind each arch. (<B>primitive jawed fish anatomy figure</B>)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Paired fins probably evolved in concert with jaws. The Earliest jawed fishes already have paired fins. The earliest paired fins were rigid structures that may have served merely as stabilizers and lift producing structures; later ones were flexible and allowed greater control of swimming. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Origin of paired fins is still unclear. Early theory held that paired fins evolved from gills and their supporting arches. Currently accepted view is<B> fin-fold theory</B>. In development, fins arise from elongate folds along the sides of body that later develop into fins by loss of the intermediate bridges. The folds resemble the ventrolateral fin folds of lancelets and the extinct agnathan <U>Jamoytius</U>. (<B>Paired fin evolution and <I>Jaymotius</I> figures</B>) </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The earliest known jawed fishes are the Acanthodians (late Silurian). Acanthodians were small (less than 20 cm long) freshwater fishes with large eyes (evidence of sight feeding), flexible bodies covered with bony, rhombic scales, an opercular series of sorts covering the gills, and heavy spines in front of the fins. The paired pectoral and pelvic fins were part of a series of ventrolateral paired fins, the presence of which is often cited as supporting evidence for the fin-fold theory of paired fin origin. (<B>Acanthodian figure</B>)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Acanthodians survived well into the Permian before going extinct but reached their peak in the early Devonian. Later forms changed in body proportions from long and slender to deep-bodied. Some lost the fins, while in others the fins became greatly exagerated. Relationships of acanthodians to other fishes remain uncertain; they have features in common with both modern sharks (carilages of the head) and bony fishes (operculum covering common gill chamber).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Placoderms (class Placodermi) appeared after the acanthodians (early Devonian) and were extinct by the early Carboniferous. Characteristics include plates of dermal bone covering the anterior of the body, with a ball-and-socket type articulation between the head and thoracic shields, cartilagenous endoskeleton, paired fins, heterocercal caudal and dorsoventral compression. Earliest placoderms were small, bottom dwelling, freshwater forms. Later ones were large, active-swimming, marine forms with reduced bony armor. The decline of the placoderms is attributed to their primitive jaw suspension (upper jaw fused to skull) and teeth (bony plates) as compared to fishes that followed. The group is so heterogeneius that it may not constitute a monophyletic assemblage. Their relationships to other fishes are uncertain, although available evidence suggests they are more closely related to chondrichthyans than bony fishes.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Seven to 11 orders of placoderms are recognized. Two of the earliest (freshwater) groups, the rhenanids and petalichthyids, bear a strong resemblance to rays and are therefore suggested to be precursors to Chondrichthyans. However, their primitive jaw morphology suggests that the similarities are due to convergence on a bottom oriented life style. (<B>rhenanids and petalichthyids</B> <B>figure</B>)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The arthrodires are among the best know and most varied placoderms. Called joint-neck fishes because of the strongly jointed necks. They were more streamlined in morphology, had long pectoral spines which may have served as anchoring devices, plate-like bones that functioned as shearing teeth. Achieved dominance in the late Devonian extinct by end of Devonian. Earliest arthrodires were small (1-2 ft). There was a trend toward increasing size and better swimming ability. One of the latest arthrodires (<U>Dinichthys</U>) reached 30 ft. (<B>Arthrodire figure</B>)</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The antiarchs and ptyctodonts were later evoloved, aberrant groups with reduced bony armor. Ptyctodonts were small placoderms that superficially resembled ratfishes. Antiarchs were armored anteriorly and somewhat compressed with dorsal eyes and long serrated pectoral spines that were jointed in the middle. Impressions reveal a soft anatomy that included functional lungs. (<B>antiarch and ptyctodont figure</B>)</P>
