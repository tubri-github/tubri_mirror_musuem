<B><P>Sensory Perception</P>
</B><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>There are four categories of sensory perception in fishes: <I>chemoreception</I> (smell and taste); <I>mechanoreception</I> (hearing, orientation, and detection of water movements), <I>electroreception</I>, and<I> photoreception</I>.</P>
<I><P>Chemoreception</P>
</I><P>Chemoreception is important in the detection of both food and noxious substances. The primary receptors are taste buds and Olfactory receptors. Taste buds are found on barbels, inside and outside the mouth, and/or on the external surface of the body. When inside the mouth taste buds are associated with <B>palatal organs</B>. Greater dependence on taste reception correlates with greater development of the facial and vagal lobes of the medulla oblongata.</P>
<P>Olfactory receptors are associated with the nares, ciliated nasal pits which in most fishes are divided into excurrent and incurrent channels by a flap of skin. The olfactory receptor (rosette) is a highly folded epithelium situated at the base of the pit. Minute quantities of chemicals cause the epithelium to transmit a stimulus to the olfactory lobe of the brain. The greater the dependence on olfaction, the more extensive the development of the pit and rosette. Olfactory cues are important in salmonid homing behavior and possibly other forms of imprinting in fishes.</P>
<I><P>Mechanoreception</P>
</I><P>The acoustico-lateralis system in fishes senses sounds, vibrations and other displacements of water. The two main components are the inner ear and the neuromast/lateral-line system. The inner ear is also responsible for the sense of balance.</P>
<P>The inner ear consists of a dorsal <B>pars superior</B> comprised of <B>semicircular</B> <B>canals</B> and the <B>utriculus</B>, and the ventral <B>pars inferior</B> comprised of the <B>saculus</B> and <B>lagena</B>. The utriculus, saculus and lagena are fluid (endolymph) filled chambers each with a sensory epithelium (<B>macula</B>) composed of hair cells, and typically containing bony concretions called <B>otoliths</B>.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Hearing sensations are produced when sound vibrations cause the otoliths to bend hair cells, stimulating neural transmissions. In a number of fishes sound vibrations pulsating off the swimbladder are carried to the inner ear by a special extension of the swimbladder (herrings) or a bridge of bones (Weberian ossicles of ostariophysans). Many elasmobranchs lack otoliths but have endolymphatic ducts which connect the inner ear to the outside environment. In these species sand grains enter the ear and function as otoliths.</P>
<P>Equilibrium and balance are sensed in semicircular canals numbering one (hagfish), two (lampreys) of three (all others) in fishes. The canals are filled with endolymph and aligned in different planes. Each has a bulbous <B>ampulla</B> containing sensory hair cells capped with a gelatinous <B>cupula</B>. Angular accelerations in either plane cause the cupula to bend, thereby stimulating the hair cells.</P>
<P>The lateralis system gives fishes a sense of "distant touch", allowing them to detect far away movements through water. It consists of a series of <B>neuromasts</B> that are either encased in pored canals or exposed at the skin surface. The structure and function of neuromasts is identical to that of sensory receptors in the semicircular canals. The more turbulent the water the greater the proportion of neuromasts in canals to reduce background noise. <B>Lateral lines</B> angle up or down around the pectoral fins or in the direction where it is critical to detect water movements. </P>
<P>The <B>cephalic-lateralis</B> system is so precise in some groups that very specialized feeding is possible without taste or sight. The cephalic lateralis system can also function as a sonar device, detecting forward displacements of water (produced in swimming) when they rebound off of distant objects.</P>
<I><P>Electroreception</P>
</I><P>Fishes detect minute electrical currents through tiny organs at the base of pits in the skin. The pits are filled with electrically conductive gel. In elasmobranchs electroreception through pit organs, called <B>ampullae of Lorenzini</B>, can be the principal means of prey location. Electroreceptors also give fishes an electromagnetic compass sense useful in navigation. For instance, they can use them to detect the electric current induced when the body passes perpendicular to the earth's magnetic field.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<I><P>Photoreception</P>
</I><P>The eye is the primary organ of photoreception in fishes (the pineal "eye" is a secondary photoreceptor important in clocking photoperiod). Blind cavefish and certain other low light adapted fishes have photoreceptors in the skin.</P>
<P>In contrast to higher vertebrates, the teleostean eye has a cornea of constant thickness and a spherical lens responsible for all focusing. The lens protrudes through the pupil and the eye bulges from the body, giving the fish a nearly complete field a view around the body (side to side head movements in anguilliform and subcarangiform swimmers eliminate even the blind spot to the rear). Most teleosts have a choroid retia for delivering oxygen to the eye. </P>
<P>In most teleosts, the retina is ellipsoid and the lens placement is somewhat anterior, allowing them to sharply focus close objects in the anterior field and distant objects in the lateral field. In many instances, the eye is egg shaped anteriorly and the side of the snout is grooved, allowing for a large anterior field of vision than otherwise possible with a lateral eye.</P>
<P>Certain adaptations allow for binocular vision. Some fish have eyes set far enough forward on the head so that the visual field overlaps (e.g., <I>Giantura</I>). Binocular vision is also possible with dorsally or ventrally placed eyes. Four-eyed fish of ocean depths have small auxillary eyes and lenses to look in other directions.</P>
<P>Many fishes are adapted for aerial vision. Four-eyed fish of Central America swim at the surface; a flap of skin divides the pupil at the water surface level. The lens is egg-shaped so that light entering from above passes through the short axis for aerial vision, and light entering from the side or below passes through the long axis for aquatic vision. The eyes have to be submerged periodically to prevent drying.</P>
<P>Regulation of light can be accomplished by several means. Elasmobranchs can reduce the pupil to the size of a pinhole or shape it into a horizontal, vertical or oblique slit to restrict incoming light. The choroid layer has a <B>tapetum lucidum</B> for reflecting transmitted light back through the retina. When present in teleosts, the tapetum is located in the retinal pigment layer.</P>
<P>Fish do not have eyelids, but some species have nictating membranes - fleshy build-ups on the front and back of the eye for streamlining - which function as partial eyelids.</P>
<P>Light and dark adaptations of fishes are largely accomplished by retinomotor movements of visual pigments in retinal cells. Under bright light conditions, the eye adapts by moving melanin toward the visual cells and movement of the outer segments of the rods into the pigmented area. In dim light, the pigment is drawn back and rods are pulled up. Movement of cones is opposite that of rods, but the cones usually are not hidden by pigment. Nocturnal species usually have more rods than cones. </P></BODY>
