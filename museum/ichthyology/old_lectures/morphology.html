<B><P>GENERAL BODY FORM AND STRUCTURES</P>
</B>
<P>Body form is a good indication of a fish's way of life.  Fast-swimming, open-water fishes (e.g., tunas and mackerel) are typically <B>fusiform</B> in shape: the body is ultra-streamlined, elliptical in cross section, and strongly tapered on both ends.  Fishes with this body form are typically rover-predators, constantly on the move in search of prey.</P>

<P>Fishes adapted for quick bursts of speed are often <B>compressiform</B> in shape: the body is compressed laterally and the dorsal, anal and caudal fins are large and set close together.  These fishes are typically ambush predators with large mouths and many teeth.  They often have disruptive pigment patterns and are secretive behaviorly.  Examples include trout, barracudas, sunfish, and snappers.</P>

<P>Bottom-dwelling fishes are typically dorsoventrally flattened (<B>depressiform</B>) with subterminal or inferior mouths.  They are often cryptically colored for concealment.  Many have barbels around their mouths for detecting food.  Examples include skates, toad fish, anglers, suckers, sturgeon, and catfish.  Some depressiform fishes (e.g., mantas) are adapted for flight-like movements above the bottom.</P>

<P>Surface oriented fishes typically have broad heads with large dorsal eyes, upturned (superior) mouths, and compressed bodies with the dorsal fin set far back on the body.  Examples include topminnows, mosquito fish, and the arawana.</P>

<B><P>Anguilliform</B> shaped fishes are elongate and round in cross section with long dorsal and anal fins, and tapering tails.  Paired fins are often reduced of absent.  These fishes are adapted for life in burrows or crevices.  Examples include eels and loaches.  <B>Taeniform</B> shaped fishes also have elongate, tapering bodies, but the bodies are laterally compressed and ribbonlike.  Examples include cutlass fish (Trichiuridae) and gunnels (Pholidae).</P>

<P>Deep-water, marine fishes are often <B>chimeriform</B> in shape,  with a large head and forebody and a strongly tapering after body and tail.  Examples include grenadiers (Macrouridae) and chimeras.</P>

<P>Many fishes have odd shapes that do not fit neatly into the any of the above catergories.  Examples include boxfishes (Ostracidae) and sea moths (Pegasidae).  Other fishes display a combination of the above shapes in different regions of the body.  The typical ictalurid catfish is depressiform anteriorly, rounded in the middle and compressiform at the tail.</P>

<P>Fins are perhaps the most conspicuous features of a fish's body.  They come in two basic types: paired fins (pelvic and pectoral) and medial fins (dorsal, anal, adipose and caudal).  </P>
<P>Fins are folds of skin supported internally by dermal structures called rays.  In jawless fishes the rays are simply rods of cartilage.  In cartilagenous fishes the fin rays are uniquely derived horny structures called <B>ceratotrichia</B>.  Fin rays in bony fishes, called <B>lepidotrichia</B>, because of their presumed derivation from rows of scales.  The fin rays of bony fishes are either segmented and flexible (soft rays), or modified into spines. </P>

<P>Paired fins are born on supporting girdles and have varying position on the body.  Pectoral fins arise from the pectoral or shoulder girdle which attaches to the skull and forms the posterior border of the gill cavity.  Ancestral bony fishes have the pectorals angled in a low, oblique position suitable for stabilization but not locomotion.  In more derived bony fishes the pectorals are moved upward onto the sides and have a vertical base suitable for locomotion and maneuvering.  In these fishes the pectoral fins are variously modified for "walking", "flying" and "feeling".</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Pelvic fins are abdominal in position and supported by a girdle that lacks internal connections in ancestral fishes.  In more derived bony fishes the pelvics are thoracic or jugular in position and connected internally to the pectoral girdle.</P>

<P>Medial fins function primarily for stabilization, but some groups also use them for locomotion and braking.  </P>

<P>Dorsal and anal fins can be short or long, continuous with the caudal fin, or variously modified into structures for reproduction, feeding or attachment.  </P>

<P>Caudal fins exist in a variety of shapes that are indicative of swimming ability.  Fish with lunate, forked or emarginate tails tend to be strong swimmers, those with truncate, rounded of continuous tails tend to be weak swimmers.</P>

<P>Early fishes have asymmetrical, <B>heterocercal</B> tails; more advanced fishes have externally symmetrical, <B>homocercal</B> tails.  An intermediate tail type seen in gars and bowfin is called <B>abbreviate heterocercal</B>.  Cods have a symmetrical, <B>isocercal</B> tail.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The skin of fishes is composed of a thin outer epidermis and a thick inner dermis.  Fish epidermis is structurally similar to that of tetrapods except that the outermost layer is not cornified or keratinized (lampreys have a nonliving cuticle).  <B>Breeding tubercles</B> or pearl organs are patches of keratinized epidermis that function for contact and territory defense in reproduction.  Certain cells in the epidermis secrete mucus which forms a protective and lubricatory covering and may assist in osmoregulation.  Venom glands and alarm substance cells are usually associated with the epidermis.  Scales, pigment cells, photophores, nerves, and blood vessels are largely restricted to the dermis which otherwise includes only loose and dense layers of connective tissue.</P>

<P>Scales are of four main types: <B>placoid</B>, <B>cosmoid</B>, <B>ganoid</B> and <B>bony ridge</B>.  Placoid scales, seen in elasmobranchs, have an inner pulp surrounded by dentine with a thin outer covering of enamel-like vitrodentine (hence the suggested homology to true teeth).  Cosmoid scales (lobefins) have a layer of cosmine sandwiched between layers of vitrodentine and vascular bone. </P>

<P>In ganoid scales (extinct paleoniscoids, sturgeon, bichirs, gar) the outermost layer is acellular ganoin and the inner layer is variously composed of cosmine and bone.   Bony-ridge scales (all other fishes) are thin and composed entirely of bone.  Two types are recognized: smooth-rimmed cycloid scales (ancestral) and tooth-edged ctenoid scales (derived).              </P>
