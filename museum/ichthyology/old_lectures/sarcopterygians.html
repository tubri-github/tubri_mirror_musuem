<P>No where is the classification of fishes more problematic than in the bony fishes (formerly Class Osteichthyes). As with "fishes" as a whole, treatment of bony fishes as a group independent of tetrapods (land vertebrates), ignores the fact that tetrapods are derived from bony fishes, and renders bony fishes "paraphyletic" (a group that comprises ancestor but not all of its descendents). With the change to <B>phylogenetic systematics</B> as the primary theory of classification, vertebrate (craniate) classification is changing to be more in line with phylogeny. Thus, Sarcopterygii, the group that gave rise to tetrapods, includes the tetrapods in modern classifications, and the remaining bony fishes (rayfins) are treated as a group equal in rank to Sarcopterygians.</P>
<P>In order to discuss bony fishes as a group, we must use the "synthetic approach" and construct a group that reflects a common <B>grade</B> in evolution that vertebrates evolved through before leaving the water. Doing this ignores the pattern of phylogeny and places the emphasis on shared primitive characteristics. </P>
<P>The grade we wish to emphasize is that of an aquatic fish-like vertebrate with a skeleton that is ossified or at least part true bone; a skull of many sutured bones (as opposed to a fused mass of cartilage); teeth that are usually fused to the jaws (as opposed to attached by ligaments); a bony operculum covering the gills; soft rays (composed of <B>lepidotrichia</B>) usually segmented and dermal in origin; nasal openings dorsal and usually divided; <B>premaxillae</B> and <B>maxillae</B> (dermal bones) usually form biting edge of upper jaw; lung or swimbladder present (absent in chondrichthyans); intestinal spiral valve present in lower forms; spiracle reduced or absent; fertilization usually external. </P>
<P>Lungs - the air-breathing structures that enabled vertebrates to move out of water - are an ancestral characteristic of bony fishes (suggests tropical, freshwater origin). Lungs are replaced by a hydrostatic organ called the swimbladder in more advanced rayfin fishes. The first lungs were ventral outpocketings of the gut (as seen in Lepidosireniformes). Lungs later moved to a dorsal position with a ventral connection (as in the Austrailian lungfish <I>Neoceratodus</I>) presumably to overcome the rolling tendency in swimming. A dorsal connection (the <B>pneumatic duct, physostomus</B> <B>condition</B>) developed next, then the connection was lost altogether (<B>physoclistic</B> condition).</P>
<P>Teleostomes show increasing occurrence of bone in skin (scales) and skeleton, particularly the skull (secondarily lost in some groups). The lepidotrichia which support the fins are derived from scales.</P>
<P>Earliest fossil teleostomes are from freshwater deposits of the lower Devonian. All of the major groups (subclasses) of sarcopterygians, and the Chondrostei of Class Actinopterygii appeared almost simultaneously.</P>
<P>Fish-like members of class Sarcopterygii have their fins on the ends of fleshy lobes (so-called lobe-fined fishes). The lobes have internal skeletal supports that are believed to be homologous to the limbs of tetrapods. The presence of lungs and fleshy lobate fins presumably enabled these fishes to move about on land, a transitional (amphibious) lifestyle that led to the evolution of amphibians. Another important characteristic for air-breathers is to have nostrils that open into the throat (upper windpipe). These so-called <B>internal nares</B> or <B>choanae</B> enabled the bearers to breath air without taking the mouth out of the water. The scales of sarcopterygians are a heavy armored type with a layer of <B>cosmine</B> (a type of dentine) in the middle. The tail varies from epichordal heterocercal to diphycercal. </P>
<P>+Subclass Osteolepimorpha is a group of Devonian lobe-fin fishes (<B>rhipidistians</B>) with choanae, branched fin rays, and an intracranial joint that differs somewhat from that seen in coelacanths. It is a matter of debate whether rhipidistians or lungfishes are the ancestors of tetrapods. Rhipidistians show the greatest homology to the earliest amphibians.</P>
<P>Subclass Coelacanthimorpha includes fossil and living coelacanths. This is the most aquatic group of lobefin fishes. In this group the palatoquadrate is separate from the neurocranium and jaw suspension is essentially hyostylic. Also, the skull is divided into distinct anterior and posterior sections by a special bone called the intracranial joint. Other characteristics include internal nares (in some); cosmoid scales; maxillae and premaxillae present; cloaca absent.</P>
<P>The coelacanthiformes is a diverse group comprising over 120 species in 47 genera. Fossil forms come from both marine and freshwater environments. This group includes what was long thought to be the only extant coelacanth, <B><I>Latimeria chalumnae</B></I>, a species that was discovered off the coast of southern Africa in 1938 and later described by J.L.B. Smith in honor of the person who brought the specimen to his attention (Ms. Courtenay Latimer). However, in 1998 a second species of coelacanth was discovered off the coast of Indonesia. Coelacanths ("hollow spine") are deepwater, marine predators. They are ovoviviparous, and their physiology and soft anatomy resembles that of chondrichthyans.</P>
<P>Fossil and living lungfishes (Infraclass Dipnoi) form a group (as yet unnamed) with the extinct Porolepiformes. Infraclass Dipnoi is characterized by internal nares (<B>choanae</B>); heavy <B>cosmoid</B> scales (primitively); palatoquadrate fused to neurocranium (<B>autostylic</B>); spiral valve; cloaca; teeth fused into grinding plates; maxillae, premaxillae lacking; atrium of heart divided by incomplete septum (primitive three-chambered heart).</P>
<P>Extant lung fishes (4 species) exhibit reduced characters when compared to early forms. South American and African forms (Lepidosireniformes) inhabit swamps and are more dependent on lungs than the Austrailian form which inhabits rivers. South American and African lungfishes burrow in mud, are eel-like and have lobefins reduced to filaments. Larvae have external gills. The African lungfish exhibits true estivation (Protopteridae); it metabolizes muscle to survive.</P>
