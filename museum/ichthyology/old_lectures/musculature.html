<B><P>MUSCULATURE AND SWIMMING</P>
</B><P>Muscles in fishes, as in other vertebrates, are classified according to their actions and/or the structures they attach to. In terms of actions, muscles are called <B>flexors</B> or <B>abductors</B> (if they move structures out away from the midline of the body (flexion), and <B>extensors</B> or <B>adductors</B> if they move parts toward the midline of the body (extension). Muscles that elevate structures are called <B>levators</B>. Muscles that lower are called <B>depressors</B>. An <B>arrector</B> is a muscles that spreads fin rays apart. </P>
<P>In terms of attachment, each muscle has an <B>origin</B>, a point of attachment that remains stationary, and an <B>insertion</B>, a point of attachment that moves. When named according to attachments, the structure the muscle originates on forms first part of the name, and the structure it inserts on forms the second part. Finally, in terms of position, <B>superficialis</B> refers to a shallow muscles, <B>profundus</B> refers to deep, and <B>medius</B> refers to intermediate.</P>

<I><P>Head musculature</P>
</I><P>Cranial musculature divided into four groups: jaw muscles, suspensorium muscles, opercular muscles, and ventral head muscles. Jaw muscles open and close mouth, suspensorium muscles control size of buccal cavity, opercular muscles control size of opercular cavity and influence expansion of buccal cavity, and ventral head muscles aid in moving respiratory water from mouth to gills.</P>
<P>A complex of four muscles called <B>adductor mandibulae complex</B> operate the jaws. <B>Adductor mandibulae 1</B> originates on quadrate and hyomadibular and inserts on maxilla; it holds maxilla in position during jaw protrusion. <B>Adductor mandibulae 2</B> originates on side of quadrate and other nearby bones and inserts on dentary; it closes mouth especially in expiration phase of respiration. <B>Adductor mandibulae 3</B> originates on quadrate, hyomandibular and others, and inserts on dentary; it also closes mouth. <B>Adductor mandibulae 4</B> originates on quadrate and inserts on underside of dentary.</P>
<P>Suspensorium muscles all originate on cranium and insert on hyomandibula. Principal muscles in this group are <B>levator arcus palatini</B> which abducts the suspensory complex enlarging the mouth, and the <B>adductor arcus palatini</B>, which lies inside the suspensorium and opposes the levator.</P>
<P>Opercular muscle group consists of four main muscles: <B>dialator operculi</B> which originates on skull and inserts on operculum; <B>levator operculi</B> (anterior and posterior parts) which originates on the skull and inserts on the opercle and helps protrude mouth and depresses lower jaw; <B>adductor operculi</B> helps compress the opercular cavilty during expiration; and <B>trapezius</B> which runs from the skull to the posttemporal bone and helps position the pectoral girdle. </P>
<P>Ventral head muslces consist of <B>intermandibularis</B>, which connects left and right dentaries drawing jaws together; <B>protractor hyoidie</B> which connects hyoid to lower jaw; <B>hyohyoideus inferioris</B> from midline to hyoid; <B>hyohyoideus abductores</B> which inserts on branchiostegal rays pulling them apart; and <B>hyohyoideus adductores</B> which opposes the abductores pulling the branchiostegal rays together. </P>

<I><P>Body Musculature</P>
</I><P>The main body musculature in fishes is arranged in blocks called myomeres or myotomes separated by sheets of connective tissue called myosepta. Myotomes form three masses: dorsal epaxial mass, ventral hyapxial mass; and lateral lateralis superficialis (red swimming muscle). Epaxials and hypaxials originate on vertebral centra and arches and insert on outer body skin. Fibers run parallel to midline of the body between myosepta. Myotomes shorten when contracted, pushing the body away from the midline and producing the side to side flexion fishes are famous for</P>

<I><P>Fin Musculature</P>
</I><P>In general, fin muscles raise (erectors) and lower (depressors) fins, pull them from side to side, or move them away from or closer to the mid-sagittal plane. Median fins (exclusive of caudal fin) are operated by muscles that originate on pterygoiphores and insert on fin rays. Erectors originate on the anterior faces of pterygiophores and insert on anterior faces or fin ray bases. Depressors originate on posterior pterygiophore faces and insert on posterior fin ray bases. Inclinators are more superficial. They originate on fascia of epaxials and insert on the sides of fin ray bases.  Contraction of inclinators cause the fins to be pulled from side to side. </P>
<P>Caudal fin rays are operated by ventral abductors, which pull them away from the body (deep and superficial) and dorsal adductors, which pull them toward the body and draw the rays together. The rays are pulled apart from above and below by arrectors. </P>
<I><P>Swimming </P>
</I><P>Swimming is the most important means of locomotion in fishes. In swimming, body muscles contract rhythmically to move the body and fins from side to side. Lateral flexures move from head to tail with increasing amplitude, pushing water adjacent to the fish backward until it is shed form the tail, producing thrust.</P>
<P>Four modes of swimming are recognized. In <B>anguilliform</B> swimming, the whole body is flexed into lateral waves of propulsion. In addition to eels, lampreys, lungfish and some sharks display this mode of swimming. Fishes that undulate between one half and one full body length (e.g., trout) are referred to as <B>subcarangiform</B> swimmers.</P>
<B><P>Carangiform</B> swimmers produce shallow waves of propulsion (generally less than one-half wavelength within the body length), usually involving only the posterior half of the body. Their bodies are fusiform and adapted for fast swimming. The fastest of these swimmers (tunas and mackerels) have a narrow caudal peduncle stiffened by a keel, and a slim, lunate caudal fin, which maximizes propulsive force with minimum wake.</P>
<P>In <B>ostraciform</B> swimming. nearly waveless contractions on alternating sides of the body pull the caudal fin from side to side in sculling type movements. This is an inefficient form of swimming characteristic of boxfishes and other tetraodontiforms. A surprising number of fishes (typically those inhabiting reefs or densely vegetated areas) use undulatory movements of their fins for most of their swimming. </P></BODY>
