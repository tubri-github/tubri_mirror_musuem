<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Euteleostei ("true teleosts") is the main line of teleost evolution with most of the species. But the group is defined on the basis of shared primitive characters (e.g., single dorsal fin, presence of an adipose fin and breeding tubercles, all of which are secondarily lost in some groups) so there is no convincing evidence that it is fact monophyletic. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Nine superorders of euteleosts are recognized: two "primitive" superorders (Ostariophysi and Protacanthopterygii) and a group of seven intermediate to advanced superorders (Stenopterygii, Cyclosquamata, Scopelomorpha, Lampridomorpha, Polymixomorpha, Paracanthopterygii and Acanthopterygii) collectively referred to as the Neoteleostei.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>In general, "ancestral", so-called "lower" euteleosts (true also for lower teleosts) share common features of soft-rayed fins, one dorsal fin near the middle of the body (although often with a small adipose fin between the doral and the tail), abdominal pelvic fins, ventral horizontally angled pectorals, cycloid scales, physostomous swimbladder and toothed maxillae included in gape.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Derived or higher euteleosts typically have spiny fins or spines in the fins; two dorsals, the first inserted further forward than in lower fishes; no adipose fin; thoracic or jugalar pelvics; pectoral mid lateral with a vertical angle and greater freedom of movement (no mesocoracoid); ctenoid scales; physoclistic swimbladder and maxillae toothless and excluded from the gape.<FONT FACE="Courier New"> </P>

<P>The most generalized euteleosts are classified in Superorder Ostariophysi. This large superorder comprises only five orders, but over one-quarter of the known fish species (over 6500), and nearly three-quarters of all freshwater fish. It is perhaps the most cohesive of the euteleostean taxa. All ostariophysans possess <B>Schreckstoff</B> (fright) substances, anterior vertebral elements modified into a hearing apparatus called the <B>Weberian apparatus</B>, and histologically unique breeding tubercles. The superorder is divided into two series: the ancestral Anotophysi with one order, the members of which contain the forerunner of the Weberian apparatus; and the Otophysi (4 orders) with distinct Weberian ossicles as part of the apparatus. The success of ostariophysan fishes in freshwater (streams) is attributed to these adaptations and relatively small body size. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The lone Anotophysan order, Gonorynchiformes contains 4 families and about 30 species. The best known gonorynchiform fish is the milkfish, <I>Chanos chanos</I> (family Chanidae), a large, brackish-water planktivore important in aquaculture in Southeast Asia. Family Gonorynchidae includes a single marine species from the Indopacific, the beaked sandfish. The most diverse group of gonorynchiform fishes is the family Kneriidae which includes small, loachlike fishes found in freshwater streams in tropical Africa.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Order Cypriniformes is believed to be the most generalized of the otophysan orders. Characteristics include protractile mouth without teeth, scaleless head, no adipose fin. The family Cyprinidae is the largest family of fishes (over 2000 species). Most species occur in Southeast Asia, but North America, Europe, and Africa also support diverse faunas. Family Catostomidae (suckers) include about 60 species of bottom feeders confined to streams of North America. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Family Cobitidae includes over 175 species of small, bottom-oriented, stream-dwelling fishes called loaches. Loaches are found mainly in southern Asia and are important in the aquarium trade.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Order Characiformes includes over 1100 species confined to Africa and Central and South America. Characins exhibit a diversity of body forms recognized in as many as 10 families, the most important of which, the Characidae, comprises over 850 species. Most characins have an adipose fin and well developed jaw teeth.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Catfishes (order Siluriformes) are easily distinguished from other otophysans by the combined presence of barbles, stout pectoral spines and adipose fin. As a group they are adapted to turbid freshwater rivers and lakes. Thirty-one families are recognized with over 2200 species. South America is the center of diversity with 13 <B>endemic</B> freshwater families; Eurasia has 9 endemic families and shares 3 with Africa. There are 3 endemic families in Africa and 1 in North America (Ictaluridae); the remaining families (Ariidae and Plotosidae) are marine and widespread.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The most widely distributed freshwater catfishes are the air-breathing catfishes, family Clariidae (over 100 species). Clariids posses stiff treelike gills that do not collapse outside of water. Some species (e.g., <U>Clarius</U> <U>batrachus</U>) use the pectoral spines to "walk" across land in order to escape low-oxygen conditions.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The "typical" catfishes throughout much of Africa and Asia are members of family Bagridae. The typical catfishes of Europe (including the largest siluriform, the commercially important European wels, which reaches 5 m in length) belong to family Siluridae. The family Ichaluridae includes the typical catfishes of North America.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Catfishes rival characins in diversity in South America with 1300+ species, a third of which are the armored catfishes of the family Loricariidae. Another group of armored catfishes, family Callichthyidae, are adapted to stagnating waters: they swallow air and "walk" on spines. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Pimelodidae fill the typical catfish role in Central and South America. Family Trichomycteridae are small, elongate catfishes, many of which are parasitic on the gill filaments of other fishes (adapted to branchial currents and the traces of nitrogenous wastes that are typically emitted from the gills). Trichomycterids of the genus <I>Vandellia </I>(candirus) of Brazil are very small and notorious for lodging themselves in the urinary tracts of humans.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Order Gymnotiformes includes 6 families and 55 species of freshwater, electric catfishes endemic to South America. They bear a remarkable similarity to some of the notopterids of Africa (convergence). They posses well developed electric organs which they use in navigation and feeding. The best known species is <I>Electrophorus electricus</I> (family Electrophoridae): about half of its body musculature is converted to electric organs capable of generating a shock of 350 to 650 V. </P></BODY>
