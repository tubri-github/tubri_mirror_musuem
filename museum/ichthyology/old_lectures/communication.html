</B>

<I><P>Coloration</P>
</I><P>Coloration plays an important role in the biology of fishes, serving for communication, concealment, advertisement and mimicry. Fishes lack coloration in only a few instances: fishes adapted to lightless caves and the larval stages of many species which are transparent.</P>
<P>Color patterns in fishes are produced by substances in special cells called <B>chromatophores</B>. Chromatophores produce colors of two basic types: <B>biochromes</B> involving actual pigments in the cells; and <B>schematochromes (or structural colors)</B>, produced by light reflecting from structures rather than pigments. </P>
<P>Chromatophores are found mainly in the dermis layer of the skin (larval nerve cord, eye, peritoneum also) and are named for the color of the substance they contain or the type of color they produce: <B>melanophores</B> (melanins) and produce blacks and browns; <B>erythrophores</B> contain carotenoids and pteridines and produce reddish colors; <B>xanthophores</B> contain carotenoids that produce yellow color; <B>leucophores</B> contain colorless mobile purines (guanine mostly) crystals which reflect light as silver or white; <B>iridiophores</B> contain large, immobile guanine crystals. </P>
<P>The wide array of colors seen in fishes are produced by varying combinations of these chromatophores. Chromatophores are controlled by the nervous and endocrine systems and in fact are derived from nerve cells. Short-term (<B>physiological</B>) color changes are produced by movements that either disperse (color) or concentrate (blanch) the pigments or crystals into the branches of the chromatophores. These color changes are under nervous control and occcur rapidly. More gradual or long term (<B>morphological</B>) color changes usually involve changes in the number of chromatophores, or in their distribution or configuration within the skin. Morphological color changes are under hormonal control.</P>
<P>The combination of pigments and structural colors produce a variety of patterns important in communication (<B>conspicuous colors</B>) and predator avoidance (<B>cryptic colors</B>).</P>
<B><P>Red coloration</B> is visually absent under low light conditions (hence, its commoness in deepwater and noctural species) and visible only at short distance in shallow water. <B>Poster colors</B> refer to the bright color patterns characteristic of reef fishes (e.g., butterfly fishes). They may be important in schooling, territorial signaling, background matching, or predator confusion or warning.</P>
<B><P>Disruptive coloration</B> (e.g., vertical bars on sunfish) interferes with the normal perception of the fish and helps to conceal it or confuse predators. Concealment often involves processes on the body in addition to background-matching coloration. <B>Eye bars</B> disrupt the eye pattern and aid in concealment. <B>Eye spots</B> and <B>lateral stripes</B> confuse predators and may help to orient fish in schools. </P>
<B><P>Countershading</B> (dark dorsally, light ventrally) causes fishes to blend in when light is coming down from above. In countershaded fishes the dorsum is usually only as dark as the water or bottom below. In pelagic fishes the sides are silvery, particularly over the red lateral muscles which would otherwise appear dark. </P>
<B><P>Polychromatism</B> (e.g., midas cichlid) is a color polymorphism produced by predator pressure. Fishes may have <B>special patterns</B>, such as the egg-mimicking spots on the fins of male cichlids.</P>
<I><P>Communication</P>
</I><P>Fishes communicate with a variety of visual, auditory, chemical and electrical signals. Electrical signals are emitted each time muscles contract. A number of fish groups (rajids, torpedinids, mormyrids, gymnotids, uranoscopids, and five other families) have independently evolved means of interpreting these electrical signals. Dependence on electrical communication is greatest in turbid water environments. Gymnotids are the best known fishes with an electrical navigation system. Their elongate bodies are kept perfectly straight when navigating in order to maintain a symmetrical electric field around the body. The fish senses interruptions in the electrical field caused by objects in the environment. </P>
<P>Chemical signaling usually involves highly specific substances called pheromones. The signals are used in species or sex recognition, social hierachies (bullhead) and predator avoidance (<B>Schreckstoff</B> reaction).</P>
<P>At least 42 families are known to communicate by producing light (mostly deepwater fishes). <B>Biolumnescence</B> in fishes involves a chemical interaction between the enzyme luciferase and the substrate luciferin. In some instances, the luminescense is associated with the digestive tract, however most lumnescent fishes have special lumnenscent structures on the surface of the body called <B>photophores</B>. Most lumnescent fishes produce their own light, however some incorporate lumnescent bacteria. The lanterneyes have photophores associated with the eyes and special black-pigmented eyelids that "turnoff" the light.</P>
<P>Fishes produce sounds either by stridulation of bones (sea catfishes), muscular vibrations of the swimbladder (toadfishes), or grinding of teeth (filefishes). Stridulatory sounds are usually amplified by the swimbladder.</P></BODY>
