</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In embryological development in fishes, as in all vertebrates, the neurocranium forms from mesodermal cartilages at the anterior end of the notochord. Paired cartilages form in the occipital, parietal (parachordal), otic, orbital, frontal (trabeculae) and nasal areas and are later joined by two expanding plates of cartilage or bone (anterior <B>ethmoid</B> plate and posterior <B>basal</B> plate). Cartilages called <B>visceral arches</B> form in the pharyngeal region to support pharyngeal gill openings and later give rise to jaws, jaw suspending structures and supports for the gills themselves.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In hagfishes, the cranium appears to have been arrested in an early stage of development. Visceral arches are not well developed. Cartilages in the head anterior to the gill pouches are interpreted as hyoid and the next two visceral arches in series, but the homology is not at all certain. The notochord persists without constriction and the only rudiments of vertebrae are small cartilages resembling neural arches in the caudal region.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In lampreys the cranium is more complete. The brain is roofed anteriorly and has sidewalls posteriorly. There is a long lingual cartilage, and separate cartilages around the mouth in the nasal region. Lampreys have an intricate (dermal) cartilagenous branchial basket, which encases to heart posteriorly.  The homology of this basket with the branchial arches of gnathostomes is unclear. The notochord is persistent with neural arch elements along its entire length.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The skeleton of cartilagenous fishes contains no true bone, but sections may be calcified to the point that they are as hard as bone. The skull (<B>chondrocranium</B>) is box shaped with a prominent rostral projection. Posterior to the jaws (palatoquadrate and Meckel's cartilages) are 5-7 gill bearing branchial arches (hyoid included). The notochord in elasmobranchs is reduced to a series of "beads" between the biconcave vertebral centra. The centra bear neural arches, lateral processes, ribs (anteriorly) and hemal arches (caudally), all of cartilage.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Median fins in elasmobranchs are supported by basal cartilages that are often separated into proximal, medial and distal elements. The pectoral fin is supported by a cartilagenous girdle consisting of outer <B>scapular</B> and inner <B>coracoid</B> portions. The pelvic girdle is simply a bar of cartilage with elongate <B>basipterygia</B> on each end.  In males the inner most basipterygia elongate to form claspers. &#9;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In most bony fishes (except sturgeon and paddlefish), the skeleton is mostly ossified with two distinct types of bone: <B>endochondral</B> bone, which replaces cartilage in development; and <B>membranous</B> or <B>dermal</B> bone which forms directly from sheets of bone secreting cells. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The cranium is composed of several separate bones. Bones of the occipital series form the back and rear floor of the skull, including the vertebral condyle. The rear of the skull is roofed with bones of the <B>otic</B> (ear) series, which also protect the membranous labyrinth (hearing organ). <B>Ethmoids</B> and <B>nasals</B> form the skull roof in the nasal region; <B>frontals</B> and <B>parietals</B> form the middle skull roof, between the ethmoids and the otic bones. These bones, along with the bones of the orbital series, bare canals of the cephalic lateralis system.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sphenoid</B> series bones form the main floor of the skull. The palatoquadrate cartilage ossifies into separate <B>palatine</B>, <B>pterygoid</B> (a series of 2-3 bones) and <B>quadrate</B> bones. Meckel's cartilage is retained in part as a thin slip of cartilage inside the dentary and angular bones, which form the lower jaw. The hyoid arch is also ossified in several parts: <B>hyomandibular</B> and <B>hyal</B> series bones (later supports the <B>glossohyal</B> or tongue) and the branchiostegal membrane. Four separate bones form the gill cover (<B>operculum</B>). There are five branchial arches composed of as many of four bones.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Each ray of the medial fins of teleosts is supported by a series of structures called <B>pterygiophores</B>, which are set deep into the body musculature. Pectoral fins are attached via an upper <B>scapula</B> and a lower <B>coracoid</B> bones to a series of bones called <B>cleithral</B> bones, which fit close behind the gill chamber and attach to the rear of the skull. Pelvic rays attach to paired plate-like structure called <B>basipterygia</B>.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The vertebral column of the typical teleost is ossified with notochord persisting only in the narrow interspaces of adjoining centra. The last vertebra (<B>ural</B>) is upturned with flat plates (<B>hypurals</B>) to which caudal rays attach. &#9; </P></BODY>
