<B><P>Reproduction</P>
</B><P>Fishes are the most fecund vertebrates, with most species capable of releasing thousands and even millions of eggs. They utilize a variety of reproductive strategies for ensuring that sufficient young survive to perpetuate the species. Most fishes lay eggs (<B>oviparous</B>), but a number of species bear "live" (developed) young. In <B>ovoviviparous</B> fishes the eggs are retained in the body but are nourished only from within the egg. In true <B>viviparous </B>fishes the embryo receives direct maternal nourishment.</P>
<P>The anatomy of the reproductive organs in fishes varies widely. Generally, however, the gonads are elongate structures suspended by mesenteries at the top of the body cavity. In lampreys the gonads are single and run the length of the body. There are no sperm ducts or oviducts; eggs and sperm are released into the body cavity and exit through pores to the urogenital sinus. Hagfishes are similar to lampreys except that the eggs are large and have a leathery shell.</P>
<P>In elasmobranchs the testes are paired structures placed anteriorly in the body cavity. They communicate with the head kidney, which is modified anterolaterally into a highly coiled epididymus. Sperm exiting the epididymus collect in the archinephric duct. Kidney in this region is modified into a secretory tissue called <B>Leydig's gland</B>, which secretes a seminal fluid. The achinephric duct courses posteriorly along the functional kidney as the vas defrens and finally the seminal vessicle which empties via a urogenital sinus into the cloaca. Sperm is delivered to the female internally via grooves in the pelvic claspers. </P>
<P>Ovaries in elasmobrachs are also paired and placed anteriorly in the body cavity, but in some species the left ovary is reduced. Eggs are released into the body cavity to oviducts that open anterior to the ovaries. They travel down to a shell gland where they are fertilized and a leathery shell is secreted. Some sharks are ovoviviparous.  Young hatch from the shell in the while still in the uterus, and later emerge. In live bearing sharks, the shell is vestigial and young develop in the posterior "uterine" portion of the oviduct.</P>
<P>In bony fishes the urinary and genital systems retain an intimate association up through the holosteans. However, the two systems are entirely separate in teleosts. As in elasmobranchs and higher vertebrates, the ovaries of primitive bony fishes release eggs to the body cavity which are then picked up by the oviducts. In teleosts, however, the ovaries are continuous (fused) to the oviduct. </P>
<P>In oviparous teleosts, the eggs may be <B>demersal</B> or buoyant. They may be adhesive, enclosed in cases, or free to drift about. Some species engage in mass spawning (walleye), others spawn in pairs. Some species spawn repeatedly (<B>iteroparous</B>), others spawn only once a lifetime (<B>semelparous</B>). Many species prepare nests; many others spawn over unprepared substrates; some parasitize the nests or bodies of other organisms (tubesnouts-tunicates, bitterlings-mussels, lumpsuckers-crabs). </P>
<P>In some species the eggs are guarded, in others the eggs are brooded in special pouches (male seahorses, forehead brooders), in the mouth (cichlids, jawfishes, osteoglossids) or in the skin (loricariids,).</P>
<P>In a number of instances, oviparity has given way to ovovivipary. In ovoviviparity, the developing embryos remain encased and receive no maternal nourishment other than that in egg yolk (many elasmobranchs, coelacanths).</P>
<P>In true vivipary there is maternal nourishment other than yolk and fishes display a variety of adaptations for accomplishing this. Some species supplement yolk with uterine secretions or material from dead eggs and embryos (livebearers). In viviparous elasmobranchs the nourishment is taken in through the embryo's mouth or delivered via elongate uterine (oviducal) villi. Some sharks have "placentae" formed by interdigitation of tissues of the yolk sac and the uterus. </P>
<P>Fishes have been classified into a number of reproductive strategies or guilds. The three main guilds emphasize a progression toward increasing parental investment in spawning and protection of young: <B>nonguarders</B>, <B>guarders</B>, and <B>bearers</B>. Nonguarders are divided into <B>open substrate spawners</B> and <B>brood hiders</B>. Guarders include <B>substratum choosers</B> and <B>nest spawners</B>. Bearers retain their eggs either <B>externally</B> or <B>internally</B>.</P>
<P>Most fish are bisexual or <B>gonochoristic</B> (sexes separate and fixed at an early stage of development). Differences between the sexes (<B>sexual dimorphism</B> or <B>dichromatism</B>) are apparent in species with internal reproduction or elaborate courtship behaviors, but they are often obscure in species that engage in mass spawning. </P>
<P>Sexual dimorphism involves characteristics called <B>secondary sex characteristics</B>, i.e., secondary to primary sex determinants (gonads). Secondary sex characteristics are either <B>requisite</B> - i.e., directly involved in copulation, oviposition, or incubation (claspers, gonopodia, brood pouches) or <B>accessory</B> - indirectly involved in reproduction (breeding tubercles or colors). Reproductive requirements of the species determine which sex is larger. In most species the female is larger because large size generally permits production of larger numbers of eggs. </P>
<P>Hermaphroditism (possession of both ovaries and testes) has evolved in a number of fishes. <B>Simultaneous</B> hermaphrodites are capable of self fertilization but typically practice outcrossing. Some gonochoristic species are occasionally hermaphroditic (striped bass). <B>Consecutive</B> hermaphrodites change from one sex to the other during their lifetime. <B>Protandrous</B> hermaphrodites start off as males then change to females; <B>protogynous</B> hermaphodites are first females then males. </P>
