<P ALIGN="CENTER">DAMS AND IMPOUNDMENTS</P>
<P>Like all forms of stream modification, the practice of impounding (damming) rivers is ancient. However, the practice has been greatly accelerated over the past century. Today, virtually every large river in North America has been impounded (many with multiple dams). We rarely talk of flow dynamics of free flowing rivers, but rather speak of rivers as having <I>regulated flow</I> regimes. </P>
<P>Dams vary in size, purpose and operation. The most important size dimension is height, because this determines the size of reservoir the dam will form. Some of the purposes dams serve are water supply, flood control, navigation, and hydropower production. Recreation is usually a secondary function of dams. Dam operation refers to the extent to which dams hold back water and the ways in which water is released downstream. An important factor influencing the impact of dams on the river ecosystems is whether water is released from the top or bottom of the dam. Low-water release dams release water from the bottom of reservoirs, which is generally cold and low in oxygen.</P>
<P>Dams transform a segment of lotic (flowing water) habitat into lentic (lake) habitat, and cause fundamental changes in community structure and ecosystem function. The physical effects of dams extend not only to the reservoir itself, but also to areas above and below the reservoir. Dams disrupt the upstream-downstream continuity of rivers (serial discontinuity). When the flowing stream encounters the standing reservoir, suspended sediment settles out. Over time, this sediment can fill the reservoir, greatly reducing storage capacity. Water released below the reservoir is sediment starved and quickly suspends fine bed materials, resulting in armoring of the streambed. </P>
<P>Already mentioned the effect of low-release dams on downstream water temperatures. Diel and even seasonal temperature fluctuations are reduced or eliminated in these instances, and year-round temperatures are often cold enough in the tailwaters below dams to support cold-water fisheries (salmon, trout, northern pike and muskellunge).</P>
<P>In terms of biological impacts of dams, the community of the impounded stretch of river changes from stream-dependent species such as minnows and darters to lake or backwater dependent species such as catfish and sunfish. The higher water clarity allows phytoplankton and rooted macrophytes to dominate primary production. Dams impede upstream migration of diadromous and other migratory fishes (e.g, salmon), causing them to disappear from upstream communities. Dam construction has had a dramatic impact of freshwater mussels, by preventing upstream migration of fish that transport larval glochidia to smaller streams.</P>
<P>A major disturbance to streams that is usually associated with impoundment is water diversion. Most water diversion projects are for irrigation and drinking-water-supply purposes. In many of these cases, so much water is removed that the rivers often fail to reach their receiving basin (Colorado River) or they reach the basin with insufficient force to prevent extensive saltwater intrusion. In a number of cases, water is diverted from reservoirs to man-made canals and tunnels designed to maximize hydropower production. The water is usually returned to the river channel, but at a considerable distance downstream and in an altered state. In a few instances, connections between historically separate rivers have been engineered for navigation purposes (Tenn-Tom Waterway, Intracoastal Waterway).</P>
<P>Increased understanding of the biological impact of restricting or diverting the flow of rivers has spawned a new area of applied river ecology, involving determining minimum flow requirements of various species. A popular method is the <I>instream flow incremental method</I> (IFIM). IFIM generates predictions about how flow restrictions affect the amount of usable habitat for fish by first simulating habitat preferences of fish and then determining how discharge variation influences availability of this habitat. The method was developed for small salmonid streams, but is now being applied to streams of all sizes across the US. The approach has many limitations, not the least of which is the fact that is bases fish habitat suitability simply on measure of depth, current and substrate complexity. Nevertheless, IFIM is the only standardized method for establishing minimum flow standards. With refinement, it should be useful for determining how much flow is required to maintain the biotic integrity of regulated stream systems. </P></BODY>
