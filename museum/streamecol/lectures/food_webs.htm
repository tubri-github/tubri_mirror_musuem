<p align=center style='text-align:center'>STREAM FOOD WEBS</p>

<p>A food web is a network of <span class=SpellE>trophic</span> (feeding)
relationships. <span class=SpellE>Trophic</span> interactions occur across a
number of different levels (<span class=SpellE>trophic</span> levels),
resulting in energy being transferred from lower to higher levels in the food
web. Stream food webs typically have three or four levels. As is typical of
most food webs, the lowest level is occupied by living <span class=SpellE>autotrophs</span>
(algae, bryophytes, vascular plants) and detritus from these organisms (most of
it <span class=SpellE>allochthonous</span>). The task of classifying the higher
<span class=SpellE>trophic</span> levels is complicated by the fact that
organisms feeding at the next level (grazers, <span class=SpellE>detritivores</span>)
consume microbes as well as primary producers. Since the microbes themselves
function mainly as primary consumers, the <span class=SpellE>macroconsumers</span>
function as both primary and secondary consumers (somewhere between levels 2
and 3). Secondary consumers (primary predators) can have mixed diets of
detritus, diatoms and animal prey, putting them between levels 2 and 4.
Tertiary consumers (secondary predators) frequently eat <span class=SpellE>algivores</span>
and <span class=SpellE>detritivores</span> (primary consumers), in addition to
primary predators (between levels 3 and 4).</p>

<p>Nature of riparian vegetation, amount of canopy cover, and watershed
characteristics are the major determinants of the energy base for stream food
webs, because they determine light levels, nutrients, and organic matter
source. </p>

<p>There are three approaches to determining food web structure: 1) gut
analysis, 2) carbon or energy budgets, and 3) stable isotope tracer studies.
Authors of this chapter describe approaches 1) and 3). First step in any food
web study is to identify <span class=SpellE>trophic</span> levels and linkages.
Most direct way to establish this is through gut analysis. <em>Gut analysis </em>simply
involves identifying and quantifying the contents of an organism's gut, using
either a portion of the gut (e.g., stomach) or the whole gut. The results are
typically reported as percentage of guts an item is found in and the mean
number of a particular prey item over all guts examined. </p>

<p>The contents of the gut can also be weighed to estimate the biomass of food
eaten and oxidized to determine the organic matter content. One must keep in
mind that what is found in the gut (especially the hindgut) is not an accurate
measure of what was eaten. Some of the food will have been digested
(particularly soft parts)<span class=GramE>,</span> some food items will not be
identifiable. Also, diets change diurnally, seasonally and with age. It is
important to be comprehensive in sampling to represent these changes.</p>

<p>The gut analysis results are used to construct a food web diagram. The
diagrams show the linkages among the different prey items and predators
identified. The food web can then be used to develop and test hypotheses about
linkages and effects of different environmental conditions on food web
structure or community stability. </p>

<p>The second major approach to <span class=SpellE>trophic</span> analysis is <em>stable
isotope analysis</em>. This method allows an investigator to look at transfers
of organic carbon and nitrogen among <span class=SpellE>trophic</span> levels.
Because the ratios of carbon (<sup>13</sup>C:<sup>12</sup>C) and nitrogen (<sup>15</sup>N:<sup>
14</sup>N) isotopes differ in different types of organic matter, one can
identify the source of the carbon or nitrogen by determining these isotopic ratios.
Organisms consuming different organic matter types will reflect the isotopic
ratio of their food. For example, if diatoms have one value (e.g., <sup>13</sup>C
= -30 relative percent), whereas streamside vegetation has another (<sup>13</sup>C
= -14), <span class=SpellE>instream</span> grazers are likely to have <sup>13</sup>C
levels closer to the diatoms, whereas <span class=SpellE>detritivores</span>
are likely to have levels closer to that of the streamside vegetation. </p>

<p>Animal tissues tend to be significantly enriched in <sup>15</sup>N relative
to their food (<st1:time Minute="58" Hour="15">2 to 4</st1:time> relative percent),
so much so that this is used as an indicator of <span class=SpellE>trophic</span>
level (e.g., organism with a <sup>15</sup>N value of 6 would be considered to
be at a higher <span class=SpellE>trophic</span> level than one with value of
3.5).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Conversely, <sup>13</sup>C
exhibits only slight enrichment (1 %<sub>0 </sub>or less) relative to their
food. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Because the <span class=SpellE>trophic</span>
transfer shift is small in carbon isotopes, but large in nitrogen isotopes, the
combination of these isotopes can be used to assess organic matter transfer
pathways in ecosystems. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p>If the isotopic ratios of different carbon and nitrogen sources don't vary,
then it is not possible to distinguish sources by this method. However, one can
deliberately introduce a carbon and nitrogen source with a distinctive isotopic
signal (e.g., corn leaf detritus or heavy isotope enriched ammonium), then look
for this signal in organisms at higher <span class=SpellE>trophic</span>
levels. Detritus entering from the riparian zone, and organisms dependent on
this detritus, will not have these ratios. </p>

<p>Two studies illustrate the ways is which stream <span class=SpellE>organsisms</span>
form food webs and the importance of these food webs to community structure. A
study by Power and Matthews (1983) examined the relationship between an algal
grazing minnow (<span class=SpellE><i>Campostoma</i></span><i> <span
class=SpellE>anomalum</span></i>), its main predators (largemouth and spotted
basses), and the distribution of stream algae in a small prairie margin stream
in Oklahoma. Pools with <span class=SpellE><i>Campostoma</i></span> were
observed to be barren, whereas pools in which <span class=SpellE>Campostoma</span>
were apparently excluded by bass supported large standing crops of filamentous
algae. <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Campostoma</i></span>
grazed actively on algae-covered stones transferred into their pools. After a
day of exposure algal biomass on the stones was reduced from 22 to 6 mg AFDM.
When a largemouth bass was tethered in the pool with <span class=SpellE><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Campostoma</i></span>, the minnows did not
feed within 30-50 cm of the bass. The results suggested that interactions
between <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Campostoma</i></span>
and their predators are important for determining pool to pool variation in the
distribution of attached algae. </p>

<p>A study by Power (1990) examined the role of fish in the food web of a
California stream. The fish (California roach and juvenile steelhead) consumed
predatory insects and fish fry, which fed on <span class=SpellE>algivorous</span>
<span class=SpellE>chironomid</span> (midge) larvae. In the presence of fish,
filamentous algae were reduced to low prostrate webs that were infested with <span
class=SpellE>chironimids</span>. When fish were prevented from preying on the
predatory insects and fish fry that normally suppress the <span class=SpellE>chironomids</span>,
algal biomass was higher and covered by diatoms and <span class=SpellE>cyanobacteria</span>.
The results of the manipulations suggested that an important theory of <span
class=SpellE>trophic</span> control - the Hairston, Smith, <span class=SpellE>Slobodkin</span>,
<span class=SpellE>Fretwell</span> theory - applies to river communities. This
theory states that plants will be alternately limited by resources or
herbivores in food webs with odd and even numbers of <span class=SpellE>trophic</span>
levels. </p>
