<P ALIGN="CENTER">DISSOLVED AND PARTICULATE ORGANIC MATTER </P>
<P>Organic matter exists in two basic forms in streams: dissolved (DOM) and particulate (POM). POM is further partitioned into fine (FPOM) and coarse (CPOM) categories based on particle size. FPOM is particulate organic matter in a size range of 0.45 m to 1.0 mm (several divisions within this). CPOM is anything above 1.0 mm. When FPOM is suspended in the water it is referred to as <EM>seston</EM>. When it is deposited in the streambed it is referred to as <EM>fine benthic organic matter</EM> (FBOM).</P>
<P>Seston consists of both living (bacteria, algae, protozoans, small invertebrates) and nonliving (fine detritus, suspended sediment) components. Seston transport loads can vary greatly from very small (microgram) amounts in small streams, to metric tons in large rivers. Seston serves as an important food source for filter-feeding invertebrates and fish. </P>
<P>FBOM has not been adequately assessed in stream research. In fact, it is often underestimated due to the fact that most of it (as much as 65%) is typically in the small to ultra-fine range. FBOM is more abundant in depositional habitats (pools) than in erosional habitats (riffles). Standing crops of FBOM tend to be low, and turnover is poorly understood. In small streams, highest standing crops are associated with pools and woody debris dams. In large rivers, backwaters and other slack-water habitats are repositories. FBOM is an important food source for collector-gatherer invertebrate and filter-feeding ("rough") fishes. Deposit feeding organisms tend to have low assimilation efficiencies, meaning that FBOM may be ingested and reingested many times as it is transported downstream.</P>
<P>CPOM is typically divided into nonwoody and woody fractions. The nonwoody component is subdivided into allochthonous (leaves, pine needles, fruits, flowers, seeds, frass) and autochthonous (fragmented aquatic plants and animals) components. The main source of energy (fixed carbon) in streams is allochthonous nonwoody CPOM. An important factor governing storage and processing of CPOM is the trapping action of the stream bed. Trapping (<EM>retention</EM>) is an essential first step that precedes microbial colonization and shredding by macroinvertebrates. Capacity for CPOM retention is a function of hydrologic conditions, riparian features and bed roughness. In general, rough beds composed of large substrates trap more CPOM. </P>
<P>The woody component of CPOM includes everything from small branches to entire (fallen) trees.  Woody CPOM often forms debris dams and serves as a trap for FPOM and non-woody CPOM.  </P></BODY>
