<P ALIGN="CENTER">SURFACE-SUBSURFACE INTERACTIONS</P>

<P>Stream ecosystems are an amalgamation of a variety of subsystems all connected by flowing water.  The subsystems may be arrayed longitudinally (e.g., riffles and pools in surface habitats), laterally (e.g., mainchannel, shoreline and backwater habitats) and vertically (surface-subsurface habitats).  This discussion is about interactions that occur between surface water and the hyporheic zone, and how conditions in streams influence these interactions.  </P>

<P>Recall that the hyporheic zone is the wetted region beneath the stream bottom.  Water flows through this zone.  However, it flows more slowly than in the surface stream because it must flow through bed materials.   The hyporheic zone exchanges material with the surface stream via water movement.</P>

<P>Exchange between surface and hyporheic zones is dictated by the character of the streambed.   Two features of streambeds are important: <I>hydraulic head</I> and <I>hydraulic conductivity</I>.  Hydraulic head is a measure of the stream's flow force and determines how far into the substrate water can penetrate.  Hydraulic conductivity is a measure of bed porosity.  It determines how easily water can travel through bed materials. </P>

<P>Obviously, little or no water penetration or flow-through can occur when the streambed is composed of unfractured bedrock, or when bedrock is close to the streambed.   Thus, surface-subsurface exchange is very limited in these situations.  Penetration and flow-through (and thus exchange) are greater when the bed is composed of coarse material (cobble, gravel) than when the bed is composed of fine material (sand, silt).</P>

<P>Hydraulic head and hydraulic conductivity tend to be greatest at riffles (convex bed areas), where water shallows, gradient is high and coarse bed materials tend to accumulate.  It is at these points where surface water penetrates the bed to the highest degree (<I>downwells</I>).  Depending of substrate coarseness, suspended sedminent and organic matter may be filtered out at the surface.  However, oxygen and dissolved materials are typically carried far down into the streambed.  Because of this, microbial communities tend to show the highest respiration rates at downwells.  </P>

<P>In pools (concave bed areas), where water slows and substrates become finer, the movement of water tends to be from subsurface to surface (<I>upwells</I>).  Oxygen concentrations tend to be low in upwells, relative to surface water, but dissolved nutrient concentrations tend to be high.  Nutrients entering at upwells can be from groundwater sources or due to the action of nitrogen-fixing bacteria and algae.  Algal biomass tends to be higher at upwells than at downwells, due to the higher availability of nutrients.  </P></BODY>
