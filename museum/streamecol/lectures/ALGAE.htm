<p align=center style='text-align:center'>STREAM ALGAE</p>

<p>Algae are a ubiquitous group of organisms. All algae are closely related on
a functional level; they are autotrophs, responsible for most of the
photosynthesis in streams. However, algae are diverse taxonomically. Algae are
classified in three different kingdoms and a number of different divisions (=
phyla of animal classification).</p>

<p>All algae have <em>chlorophyll a</em> and lack multicellular gametangia.
They have simple organization, existing either as single cells, colonies, or
strands of cells. </p>

<p><br>
<em>Taxonomic classification<o:p></o:p></em></p>

<p>Algae are classified in as many as 10 different divisions. Classification of
algae is based on 1) pigmentation, 2) chemistry and structure of internal
storage products, 3) cell wall composition, and 4) flagellation. A
classification is presented below for groups of algae found in streams. The
groups are listed in order of decreasing importance.</p>

<p>Diatoms are classified in Division Bacillariophyta of Kingdom Protista. They
have chlorophylls a and c, with carotenoids that make them appear brown or
golden in color. They are probably the most widespread and abundant of all
algae in streams. They have silicious cell walls in two halves with a slit in
the middle that allows them to be motile.</p>

<p>Green algae are classified in Division Chlorophyta, often in Kingdom Plantae
(although most consider them to be protists). They mainly have chlorophylls a
and b. The cell wall is made of cellulose and pectin. They are green in color
and usually filamentous. Growths of filamentous green algae may be extensive in
well-lit streams with course bottoms.</p>

<p>Blue-green algae are classified in Division Cyanophyta of Kingdom Monera
(bacteria). They are also called cyanobacteria, and are the only <em>procaryotic</em>
algae. They have chlorophyll a and phycobilins and appear blue-green to olive
in color. They occur as mats or filaments.</p>

<p>Yellow-green (or golden) algae are classified in Division Chrysophyta of
Kingdom Protista. They have chlorophylls a and c, are yellow-green in color,
and have cell walls of cellulose and pectin. Only a few genera of yellow-green
algae occur in streams and all are filamentous.</p>

<p>Red algae are classified in Division Rhodophyta of Kingdom Plantae. They
have chlorophyll a and phycoerythrin. They are olive to maroon in color. Most
red algae are marine, but several filamentous groups occur in streams.</p>

<p><br>
<em>Ecological classification<o:p></o:p></em></p>

<p>Algae may also be classified into different ecological categories. They are
typically attached to something and are most often referred to as a component
of <em>periphyton. However, </em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>t</span></em>his
term technically means &quot;on or around plants&quot; and should be reserved
for organisms growing on vascular plants. Included among &quot;periphyton&quot;
are various microscopic and short-filament algae, microbes, animal protists and
meiofauna. All of these organisms, grow on a variety of substrates (living and
nonliving). Thus, it is becoming more common to use different terminology to
refer to organisms growing on different types of substrates. Another term for
algae and other organisms growing on plants is <em>epiphyton</em>. When
attached to animals, algae and other organisms are called <i>epizoon</i>. When
attached to rocks, they are called <em>epilithon</em>. When attached to wood,
they are sometimes referred to as <em>epidendron</em>. <em>Episammon</em>
refers to organisms growing on sand. <em>Epipelon</em> refers to organisms
attached to fine sediment. </p>

<p>There is considerable microhabitat specificity. For example, epipelic
communities are dominated by motile diatoms that can move over and between fine
sediment particles; whereas, epilithon is dominated by non-motile (attached)
diatoms and filamentous algae. <em>Physiognomy</em> refers to the physical
structure of a community. Algae can occur in motile, nonmotile or prostrate
forms. They can be attached by mucilagenous pads or stalks. They can occur as
short filaments or long filaments that extend above the surface of the
substrate.</p>

<p><i>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p><i>Ecological role<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p>First and foremost, algae are producers that provide an important, fresh,
fixed carbon source to herbivores. Algae is nutritionally superior to detritus
(dead organic matter). Algae also produce oxygen for aerobic organisms, and are
useful<em> indicator</em> organisms. Benthic algae community composition is
reflective of water quality. For example, dominance of algal communities by
blue-green algae is generally a sign of excessive nutrient enrichment.</p>

<p><i>Biomass and pigments <o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p>Biomass determination is an important way of assessing a particular taxon's
importance in a community or a community's importance to an ecosystem.
Measurement of benthic algal biomass is complicated by the fact that benthic algae
are a component of a community that includes bacteria, fungi, and protozoans.</p>

<p>Although the most important energy source for streams is allochthonous dead
organic matter, autochthonous, autotrophic production can be substantial.
Already mentioned that algae are superior to detritus as a food source.
Modeling and empirical studies suggest that lotic algal biomass can support
10-20 times more grazer biomass than detritus. So the algal biomass one
measures in a stream at any particular time is not a good indication of the
herbivore biomass it can support.</p>

<p>Not all algal biomass produced in an area is consumed by herbivores.
Laboratory studies suggest that a large amount of the algae grazed by snails is
transported downstream. <em>Sloughed algal biomass </em>can be an important detrital
source for filtering heterotrophs.</p>

<p>Short-term changes in algal biomass can be used as an index of algal
productivity. However, one must be careful to account for grazing, upstream
inputs, and downstream losses.</p>

<p>There are three main approaches to determining algal biomass. <em>Ash-free
dry mass</em> calculation involves drying a collected sample to constant
weight, oxidizing in a muffle furnace, and measuring the loss in weight due to
oxidation. This provides a measure of total organic matter in a sample, but it
doesn't allow one to distinguish algal biomass from other periphyton, and it
doesn't account for the physiological state of the organic matter (dead or
living).</p>

<p><i>Pigment analysis</i> involves extracting pigments from collected samples
and measuring each pigment's absorbance of light of different wavelengths.
Because different pigments absorb maximally at different wavelengths, pigment
analysis provides clues as to the types and concentrations of pigments present.
This allows differentiation of algal biomass from other organic biomass.</p>

<p><i>Biovolume measurement</i> involves measuring the dimensions of algal
cells under a microscope and calculating cell volumes for each species. When
included with determination of algal community composition, this method
provides information on biomass for each algal species. However, this is very
labor intensive and it is difficult to distinguish live cells from dead cells
under the microscope. </p>
