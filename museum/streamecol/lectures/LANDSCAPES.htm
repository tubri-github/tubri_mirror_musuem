<p>Streams are formed as by water falling on the land as precipitation and
gradually making its way (ultimately) to the sea. Streams flow because the land
has relief in the form of mountains, hills, terraces or (stream-cut) canyons. </p>

<p>Water enters streams in two main forms: as <em>runoff</em> (water running
over the surface of the land) and as subsurface or <em>hyporheic</em> flow
(groundwater). Whether water runs off the surface or enters through the
subsurface depends on the permeability or porosity of the land. If all water
enters as runoff streams would dry up shortly after rainfall events. The more
water that enters the groundwater, the longer it is retained by a watershed (<i>storage</i>),
and the longer it charges the streams from below. </p>

<p>When water flows over rocks and soil on land it picks up material (<em>erosion</em>).
The faster water flows, the more and bigger the material it can carry (<i>bedload</i>).
As the water slows, the material falls out of suspension (<em>deposition;</em> <em>sedimentation;
alluviation</em>).</p>

<p>Even within streams, where water flows the fastest, one typically sees the
coarsest material (rocks, boulders); where it flows slowly, one typically sees
the finest bed material (sand, silt).</p>

<p>Stream ecologists like to think about streams from the standpoint of all of
the land they drain (a <em>drainage basin </em>or <em>catchment; Landscape
perspective</em>). Catchment = all of the land area the stream is collected
from. Streams are thus said to have characteristics of <i>watershed, drainage</i>
or <i>catchment area</i>. </p>

<p>Streams range in size from smallest seep or brook to largest river. Within a
catchment basin, streams of different size form a network, with small streams
connecting to form larger and larger streams. By one method of stream
classification (<em>Strahler method</em>), smallest streams (those that
typically originate at the highest points of the catchment) are called <em>1<sup>st</sup>
order streams</em>. These don't receive other streams and are often <em>intermittent.</em>
Where two 1<sup>st</sup> order streams meet, a <em>2<sup>nd</sup> order stream</em>
forms. Where two 2<sup>nd</sup> order streams meet a <em>3<sup>rd</sup> order
stream</em> forms. A stream increases in order only when it receives a stream
of like order; order does not change if streams of lower order are added. 1<sup>st</sup>
to 3<sup>rd</sup> order streams are typically referred to as <em>headwater
streams</em>. Streams are no longer wadable when they exceed 5<sup>th</sup>
order. The lower Mississippi River is a 11<sup>th</sup> order stream.</p>

<p>Streams have four dimensions: a <em>longitudinal dimension</em> (upstream to
downstream continuum), a <em>lateral dimension</em> (traces water from channel
to adjacent shore), a <em>veritical dimension</em> (down into the substrata),
and a <em>dimension of time</em> (seasonal or longer-term changes in
conditions).</p>

<p>Physical and chemical conditions change along each of these dimensions, and
biotic communities respond to these changes. Longitudinal dimension is the most
obvious because it is easiest to view. <em>Longitudinal zonation </em>is term
used to describe the very obvious pattern of biotic change along the length of
a stream (distinct headwater, intermediate and large stream communities). <em>River
continuum concept</em> (RCC) is a conceptual framework that was proposed in
1980 to describe upstream to downstream changes in the physical, chemical and
biological attributes of streams.</p>

<p>The basic premise of the RCC is that as a stream increases incident light,
nature of organic, photosynthesis and respiration, temperature variability,
turbidity, and structure and function of biotic communities change in
predictable fashion. </p>

<p>When we modify streams, we upset the continuum (by impounding streams)
creating a serial discontinuity (<em>serial discontinuity concept</em>), in
which the normal pattern of upstream to downstream change in physical and
biological conditions is reset. </p>
