<p align=center style='text-align:center'>PRIMARY PRODUCTION AND COMMUNITY
RESPIRATION</p>

<p>Primary production is the rate of production of organic matter (fixed
carbon) from inorganic carbon by photosynthesizing organisms (units = mass<span
class=GramE>/(</span>area [or volume] x time)). Thus, it represents the
transformation of solar energy to reduced chemical energy. The total amount of
energy produced is gross primary productivity (GPP). Of course the plant uses
some of the energy in its own respiration (R<sub>a</sub>). The balance is
stored as plant biomass and is called net primary productivity or NPP.</p>

<p>Thus,</p>

<p><i>GPP = NPP + R<sub>a<o:p></o:p></sub></i></p>

<p>In streams, the source of carbon for plant biomass production is CO<sub>2 </sub>dissolved
in water. Oxygen is produced in the process. Thus, it is possible to measure
the rate of primary production by measuring changes in CO<sub>2 </sub>and O<sub>2</sub>
(usually) concentrations in water. Another method is to measure the rate of
uptake of radioactively labeled [<sup>14</sup>C] bicarbonate. The <sup>14</sup>C
uptake method provides productivity measures between GPP and NPP. It is more
sensitive than the gas exchange method and thus provides better estimates when
primary productivity is low.</p>

<p>A number of stream ecologists use an <em>in situ</em> method of determining
gas (O<sub>2</sub>) exchange rate based on the equation:</p>

<p><span class=GramE><i>Q<sub>(</sub></i></span><i><sub>dissolved O2)</sub> = P
- R +/- E,</i> </p>

<p><span class=GramE>where</span> <em>P</em> = change in [O<sub>2</sub>] due to
photosynthesis, <em>R</em> = change due to respiration, and <em>E</em> = change
due to exchange with the atmosphere (assumes negligible accrual from surface
and groundwater inputs). The change due to respiration includes both <span
class=SpellE>autotroph</span> and <span class=SpellE>heterotroph</span> (<span
class=SpellE>R<sub>h</sub></span>) respiration. The two of these respiration
rates combined is called <em>community respiration</em> (CR). CR can be
measured only at night (measurement confounded in daytime by plant O<sub>2</sub>
production). Thus, daily CR (CR<sub>24</sub>) is estimated by extrapolating
average nighttime CR through the daylight hours.</p>

<p>Estimates of GPP derived in this way will be subject to error from (1)
differences in light and dark respiration, including the inability to account
for photorespiration by plants (light-dependent O<sub>2</sub> uptake and CO<sub>2</sub>
evolution, and excretion of <span class=SpellE>photosynthate</span>); (2)
inability to measure autotrophic respiration separately; and (3) any asynchrony
between photosynthesis and associated metabolic costs.</p>

<p>Net daily metabolism (NDM) can be estimated from the difference between GPP
and CR<sub>24</sub>:</p>

<p>NDM = GPP - CR<sub>24<o:p></o:p></sub></p>

<p>NDM is free of errors associated with estimation of daytime respiration. If
GPP exceeds CR<sub>24</sub>, then there is net energy gain to the system; if CR<sub>24</sub>
exceeds GPP then there is net energy loss. It is for this reason the NDM is
also referred to as <em>net ecosystem productivity</em>.</p>

<p>In small to medium-sized streams, the greatest portion of biomass, and
therefore the greatest metabolism, is in the <span class=SpellE>benthose</span>.
In large rivers, water column biomass (plankton) dominates productivity. In
some systems, <span class=SpellE>macrophyte</span> (large vascular plant)
productivity can be significant.</p>

<p><span class=SpellE>Respirometer</span> chambers, equipped for water
recirculation, may be used to measure metabolism (introduced for use with <span
class=SpellE>benthose</span>). Although free of the need to correct for gas
exchange, there are concerns about how chamber design influences nutrients,
water flow, and the ratio of sample surface to water volume, relative to the <em>in
situ </em>method.</p>

<p><sup>14</sup>C uptake method has been little used in streams. This is
because corrections must be made for adsorption of isotope onto surfaces and
for proportions of <span class=SpellE>photosynthate</span> excreted by the
producer as labeled organic matter. The method is best applied in closed
systems. </p>
