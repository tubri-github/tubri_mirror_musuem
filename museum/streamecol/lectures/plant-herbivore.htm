<P ALIGN="CENTER">PLANT-HERBIVORE INTERACTIONS</P>
<P>Herbivory is usually defined as the consumption of living plant matter by animals. Since the consumption is occurring one step above the production level, it is also referred to as <EM>primary consumption.</EM> The term <EM>grazing </EM>is also used because the plant material is repeatedly cropped by <EM>grazers</EM>. Plant-herbivore interactions are some of the most basic interactions in ecosystems, and the link between primary production and higher level consumption.</P>
<P>In streams, it would probably be more appropriate to refer to plant-herbivore interactions as algae-herbivore interactions, because most of the primary production is by stream algae (in most streams, involvement of bryophytes and vascular plants is limited). Herbivores include a wide variety of invertebrates (insects, crustaceans, snails) and a limited variety of vertebrates (fish, amphibians).</P>
<P>In streams with limited riparian shading and allochthonous inputs, algal production can dominate the annual energy budget. Algal production is typically highest in middle-order streams because shading is limited and water is typically shallow and clear. In large rivers, primary production shifts to phytoplankton due to high turbidity and increased depth. Algal biomass can support high herbivore biomass even in small, heavily shaded streams, because of its high nutritional value and turnover rates. </P>
<P>Herbivores are usually effective consumers of algal standing crops. It is unusual to see high algal biomass in streams. However, low algal biomass is not necessarily an indication of heavy grazing pressure. This can result from low light levels, low nutrients, seasonal factors, lack of firm substrates, and disturbance. The best way to determine how herbivores are influencing algal biomass is to do controlled experiments that allow you to quantify differences in algal biomass production under different grazing regimes. Simple herbivore exclusion and enclosure experiments permit quantification of algal response in the absence and presence (respectively) of the herbivore or with varying herbivore densities.</P>
<P>A study by Power et al. (1988) used short-term exclusion experiments to examine grazer influence of algal community composition in an Ozark stream.  The authors observed that stony substrata in streams of the southwestern Ozark mountains were covered with cyanobacterial felts dominated by <I>Calothrix</I> sp., an important nitrogen fixer.  To examine the effects of grazers on producer assemblages, the authors alternately exposed and protected patches of stream bottom from grazing fishes and invertebrates for periods ranging from 4-33 days.  When protected from grazers, the cyanobacerial felts were overgrown by turfs of benthic diatoms within 4-10 days.  Diatom turfs also developed on bare substrata that were incubated in sites in the stream inaccessible to grazers.  Diatom turfs exposed to grazing minnows were stripped off in 3-5 minutes, and when left exposed to grazers, were replaced by cyanobacterial felts within 11 days.  The authors concluded that by selectively feeding on diatoms, grazers were maintaining a high proportion of nitrogen fixers in producer assemblages, which could enhance primary productivity in the system.</P>
