<p align=center style='text-align:center'>HABITAT USE AND COMPETITION IN STREAM
FISHES</p>

<p>Community ecologists are interested in understanding how is it that so many
kinds of organisms can coexist in space and food-limited environments. They
theorize that organisms specialize in morphology and life habits so that they
don't have the same needs (occupy different niches), or they occupy habitats at
different times or live in different habitats so they won't overlap in resource
use. </p>

<p>It is true that fishes and other stream organisms exhibit a variety of body
forms, life habits, and habitats. Some fishes are specialized to live in fast <span
class=GramE>water,</span> others are better suited to live in slack water. Some
live on the stream bottom, others live in the water column. Some favor the
shore areas along the sides of streams, others prefer mid channel. Some are
active by day, some by night. </p>

<p>An important question in stream fish community ecology (as for any area of
community ecology) is: How did these differences in body form and life habits
come about? Are they the result of interspecific competition (&quot;ghosts of
competition past&quot;), or are they independently evolved traits that in
effect preadapt species for coexistence? </p>

<p>When you were collecting fishes from our study streams, did you notice
differences in habitats where minnows were coming from? When you sorted and identified
the minnows, did you notice any morphological differences among species that
would serve to segregate the species in terms of types of food eaten or area of
the water column inhabited? </p>

<p>Over long periods of time, we can imagine that closely related species that
evolved in different places (i.e., diverged from a common ancestor) can come to
occupy the same stream, and even share the same habitat. In fact, it is common
for species that share similar phylogeny, morphology, behavior, and ecological
requirements to occur together in the same habitat, and thus have the potential
to compete.</p>

<p>One of the ways species avoid competition is through habitat partitioning:
subdivision of habitat space based on microhabitat features. Thus, within a
riffle, one species might be specialized to live in the fastest portion of the
riffle, while another might favor slower portions. You might expect, therefore,
that these microhabitats would differ in water velocity, substrate composition
(larger substrates in fast water), depth, and accumulations of detrital
material. At a broader scale one species may favor riffles in small streams,
whereas another may favor riffles in large streams. </p>

<p>Stream fishes clearly segregate in these ways. The question is: Are they
segregating in this way because of ongoing or past <i>in situ</i> competition,
or are they expressing historically evolved traits? One of the best ways to
investigate this is through natural experiments: quantify the habitat use of a
species in the presence or absence of potential competitors; then look for
evidence of a shift in habitat association in the presence of a competitor.</p>

<p>Gorman (1988) did an experimental study of habitat use in an assemblage of
Ozark minnows. A previous field study had shown that species were segregated in
pools primarily on the basis of a single habitat variable: position in the
water column. Lack of control over species combinations and densities prevented
Gorman from determining the relative contribution of habitat preference versus
interspecific competition to habitat use patterns. Aquaria were used to
simulate pool habitats in a series of laboratory experiments designed to
determine the prefered vertical distribution of six minnow species. Three of
the species had distinct vertical position preferences. A series of pairwise
and multispecies experiments were then conducted to determine the effect of
interspecific association on vertical position preference. Thirty four of 45
possible pairwise interactions were significant (18 positive associations; 16
negative associations). Mean pairwise overlaps were larger for positive
associations than for negative assocations. Interactions were complex in three
and four-species experiments. Species exhibited flexibility in their vertical
distributions, adjusting their position in response to certain heterospecifics
(as identified in pairwise associations). The flexibility in habitat use
observed in the laboratory explained the variability oberved in the field and <span
class=GramE>suggested</span> that interspecies interactions (positive and
negative) were important determinants of habitat use patterns. </p>
