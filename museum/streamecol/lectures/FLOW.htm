<p align=center style='text-align:center'>FLOW MEASUREMENTS AND DYNAMICS</p>

<p>Flowing water is the definitive characteristic of a stream. Everything that
a stream ecosystem is happens because water flows. This lecture concerns the
measurement and dynamics of flow.</p>

<p>Stream flow, also referred to as <em>discharge</em>, is a volumetric
measurement. It is the volume of water passing a particular point in a stream
over a particular period of time. A stream flows past a particular point at a
rate called <i>velocity</i> (distance/time). The volume of water passing a
given point along the stream is the velocity times the cross-sectional area,
approximated as mean depth times width. The most common unit of flow in English
Units is cubic feet per second of <i>cfs </i>(cubic meters per sec or <em>cumecs</em>
in SI units).</p>

<p>Stream flow is monitored by various state and federal water resource
management agencies, but mainly the Water Resources Division of the U.S.
Geological Survey (USGS). The USGS maintains a large number of stream gaging
stations on streams of different sizes in drainge systems across the U.S. The
gages record the height or <em>stage</em> of the surface of the water relative
to a fixed datum (national geodetic datum ~ mean sea level) at 15-minute
intervals. By measuring how stream stage or gage height relates to discharge,
hydrologists produce a <em>rating curve,</em> which they can then use to
predict discharge for the various stage measurements.</p>

<p>The USGS has been monitoring stream flow at some stations for long periods
of time (50 years or more). Graphs depicting how stream flow varies over time
(short or long intervals) are called <i>hydrographs</i>. By studying patterns
in hydrographs, hydrologists or stream ecologists can determine the runoff and
storage characteristics of different watersheds, or the tendency and frequency
of floods and droughts. </p>

<p>The length of time it takes a daily hydrograph to respond to a rainfall
event depends of the storage characteristics of the watershed. In general the
more porous the soils and the larger and more dense the vegetation cover, the
greater the storage capacity and the longer the hydrographic response (contrast
a city to a forest). The more storage there is, the longer a stream is charged
by groundwater flow. </p>

<p><i>Flow-duration curves</i> relate discharge to the percentage of time
(typically over the course of a year) that particular discharges are equaled or
exceeded. Streams with steeply-sloped curves receive most of their discharge as
runoff. Streams with flat curves have high storage. </p>

<p>A <em>flood-frequency curve </em>shows the periodicity of floods of
different magnitudes (e.g., 100-year flood). Another way of depicting a
discharge pattern or variability over time is with a <em>cumulative-discharge
curve</em>. Changes in the shape of the curve from year to year or over longer
periods represent changes in discharge patterns.</p>

<p>Stream flow is also affected by conditions within the stream itself. Stream
velocities are highest just above the <em>thalweg,</em> the deepest point along
the channel cross section. It is here that there is the least amount of
frictional drag (resistance to flow). Resistance to flow is greatest along the
streambed and is a function of bed roughness. Hydrologists speak about the <em>wetted
perimeter</em> of a stream (distance along the bottom from shore to shore of a
particular cross section), the <em>hydraulic radius</em> (ratio of
cross-sectional area to wetted perimeter) and <em>hydraulic depth</em> (ratio
of cross-sectional area to surface width).</p>

<p>We can also talk about dynamics of flow at different scales (segment, reach,
habitat, microhabitat) within a stream. Because of the frictional forces
applied by the streambed, the pattern of flow is non-uniform. At the
stream-reach scale in alluvial valley segments, regularly recurring floods
redistribute bed materials, producing riffles, pools and meanders with amazing
predictability. The natural wavelength of flood flows tends to be 6 times
channel width, which roughly corresponds to the spacing of pools and riffles.
The stream channel meanders with an average wavelength of 12 bankfull widths,
and each full meander tends to have two riffles and two pools.</p>

<p>At the habitat scale, flow dynamics are dictated more by flow momentum and
gravitational force, than by boundary friction. In riffles and rapids, flow is
divided into non-uniform segments that change from smoothly accelerating (as
over or around boulders or other obstacles) to decelerating and turbulent (as
in hydraulic jumps and eddy swirls). As flow drops over an obstacle or through
a narrow gap it reaches <em>critical</em> (maximal) <em>velocity </em>for the
head of water above the obstruction. The <em>critical depth</em> of flow occurs
as the water passes over the obstruction and is 2/3 upstream head. The
relationship between critical velocity (<i>V<sub>c</sub></i>) and critical
depth (<i>d<sub>c</sub></i>) is given by:</p>

<p align=center style='text-align:center'><i><span style='font-size:16.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt'>V<sub>c </sub>= (gd<sub>c</sub>)<sup>½ <o:p></o:p></sup></span></i></p>

<p>where <i>g</i> is gravitational acceleration (9.81 m/s).</p>

<p>If the water continues to accelerate past an obstruction, it attains <i>supercritical
flow</i>. This brings water into the air and causes the whitewater plume seen
in a hydraulic jump where the flow rapidly rotates vertically, decelerates, and
then climbs to the higher depth of the water downstream. The splashing water
and breaking bubbles are the source of noise in a babbling brook and a roaring
rapid (uniform flow makes no noise). The state of flow relative to critical
velocity is called the <em>Froude number </em>and is represented by the
equation:</p>

<p align=center style='text-align:center'><i><span style='font-size:16.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt'>Fr = V<sub>m</sub>/(gd)<sup>½<o:p></o:p></sup></span></i></p>

<p>where <i>V<sub>m</sub></i><sub> </sub>is mean velocity (m/s) and <i>d</i> is
depth of flow (m). The Froude number has a value of 1 at critical flow; is less
than one at subcritical flow and greater than one at supercritical flow.</p>

<p>Critical and near-critical flows are efficient habitats for net-spinning
caddisflies and black flies, which trap particulates from the water column.
These insects are typically found along the tops of boulders or logs near the
critical flows. Fish also take advantage of different zones of flow, moving
into calmer eddies below boulders and other obstructions to maintain position
less energetically. Salmon are able to jump over obstacles by swimming to the
top of hydraulic jumps and propelling against the tumbling water. </p>

<p>Techniques are limited for measuring flow conditions at the microhabitat
scale. This is the scale at which near-boundary, laminar flow conditions can be
detected. In the laminar boundary layer, water moves in parallel lines without
mixing. </p>

<p>We can think of flowing water producing shear stresses on the streambed as
it releases energy as frictional force. The stress is called <em>tractive force</em>
and depends on the density of water, the height of the water surface (a measure
of kinetic energy) and the stream hydraulic radius. The amount of tractive
force applied determines substratum stability, size of material transported,
and density and composition of benthic community. </p>
