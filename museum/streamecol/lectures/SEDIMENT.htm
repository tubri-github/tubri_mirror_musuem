<P ALIGN="CENTER">SUSPENDED SEDIMENT AND BEDLOAD</P>
<P>We have been talking about the physical attributes of streams and stream channels. We are now ready to talk about the work streams do, picking up material from one portion of a watershed, and carrying it to another. We'll first talk about transport of inorganic material, and then organic material in various size ranges.</P>
<P>All streams have a bed composed of different types of material: bedrock, rock, cobble, gravel, sand, silt, mud, clay. The material comes from the surrounding land. The larger particles are gradually eroded, but can reside in stream beds for long periods of time. The finer particles eventually end up on the sea floor, in coastal marshes, estuaries, or as new coastal land.  </P>
<P>Inorganic material is transported to streams by two different processes: <EM>surface erosion </EM>and <EM>mass wasting</EM>. Surface erosion is the gradual erosion of inorganic material from the surface of the land. It is more extensive where the land surface is unprotected (deserts, agricultural lands, forest clear cuts). Mass wasting is transport of material <EM>en masse</EM>, as with a landslide or failure of a hillslope.</P>
<P>A number of factors influence amount of material transported to and within streams (precipitation, topography, vegetation, geology, disturbance). Movement of inorganic material into and within streams is referred to as <EM>sedimentation</EM>. </P>
<P>There are two modes of sediment transport in streams: <EM>suspended </EM>and <EM>bedload</EM>. </P>
<EM><P>Suspended sediment</P>
</EM><P>Suspended sediment is mass of sediment carried in water per unit of water volume. Typically involves small silt and clay sized particles (less than 0.1mm diameter). Sediment remains suspended in water as long as the water is moving; amount and size of sediment depends on how fast the water moves (positive relationship).</P>
<P>Suspended sediment concentration is highly variable. It typically reaches higher concentrations during a rising hydrograph (when water is flowing faster and has a low sediment load to begin with) than during falling hydrograph (when flow is slowing and sedminent begins to fall out of suspension).</P>
<P><BR>
<EM>Bedload sediment</P>
</EM><P>Bedload sediment consists of relatively large sediment (&gt;1 mm diameter). Measured as a mass of bed material transported past a given point per unit of time (kg/s or mt/day). Because particles are larger, they can't be sustained in water column. Rather, they tend to roll, slide or saltate (bounce up and down) near the streambed. Because of its mass and proximity to the stream, movement tends to be slowed by frictional resistence. Moreover, transport takes place only only during periods of high flow.</P>
<P>Particles between 0.1 mm and 1.0 mm diameter can be transported either as suspended sediment or bedload, depending on flow conditions (suspended at higher flows; bedload at lower flows). </P></BODY>
