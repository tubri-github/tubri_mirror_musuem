<P ALIGN="CENTER">BIOTIC INDICATORS OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY</P>
<P>Streams are complex environments, offering a variety of conditions for organisms to adapt to (temperatures, light levels, substrate types, depths, flows, suspended loads, solutes, etc.) and predictable set of relationships among various habitat parameters. Organisms have responded to this environmental variability by adopting a variety of different life modes (niches) with varying degrees of tolerance of the range of conditions offered. For example, species that favor moderate water flows perform best in these flows, but poorly in slow or fast flows. The same generalization can be made for any environmental parameter. </P>
<P>The composition of a stream's biota reflects the environmental conditions present in the stream. Thus, it should come as no surprise that stream biota themselves are used to assess the quality of the stream environment. This is especially useful where human activities have upset the natural balance of stream conditions. </P>
<P>If the main concern is environmental quality, it may seem like a better approach to measure environmental conditions directly. This approach has two drawbacks: first, the particular set of environmental conditions that define a healthy environment are rarely known; second, conditions measured in the present tell only about the present. Use of biotic indicators tells about past and present disturbances and provides a means of identifying the correlated environmental parameters.</P>
<P>There are many different approaches to biotic monitoring. At a general level, one may be concerned about the loss of diversity. In this case, a simple species (<EM>richness</EM>) count or <EM>diversity index</EM> may be used. One can compare loss of diversity over time or diversity in a disturbed area to that in a pristine area.</P>
<P>Another approach involves enumeration of organisms in broad taxonomic or ecological categories. For example, common metrics used are numbers or proportions of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera (EPT), and percentage or ratios of shredders and collectors. </P>
<P>Biotic indicators reveal more when they are based on the tolerance of organisms to particular environmental conditions. Use of tolerance-based indices is based on the premise that disturbance tolerance varies among organisms. Individual species or groups of species (taxonomic or functional) are typically assigned a tolerance score for a particular type of pollutant or anthropogenic disturbance (sewage, agriculture). The higher a taxon's score, the higher its tolerance.</P>
<P>An example of a tolerance-based indicator is the <EM>Family Biotic Index </EM>(FBI), which was developed for macroinvertebrates. Various families of macroinvertebrates have been assigned tolerance scores based on their perceived disturbance tolerance (<A HREF="http://www.tubri.org/museum/streamecol/lecture/appendix311.htm">APPENDIX 31.1</A>). By tabulating the number of individuals of each family in a sample, multiplying this by the family's tolerance score, summing over all families, and dividing by the total number of organisms, one obtains a index of quality of the stream where the sample was taken. Different ranges of FBI indices have been related to different levels of stream quality in regional studies (<A HREF="http://www.tubri.org/museum/streamecol/lecture/table314.htm">Table 31.4</A>).</P>
<P>A similar index has been developed for stream fishes: <EM>Index of Biotic Integrity</EM> (IBI). The index was originally developed for agriculturally disturbed streams of the upper Midwest, but has since been adapted to streams in a number of other settings. The IBI combines metrics of species richness and compostion, trophic composition and fish abundance and condition (12 metrics in all). Each metric is scored 5, 3 or 1 based on whether the particular biotic conditions in the study stream approximates, deviates somewhat, or deviates strongly from that in a relatively undisturbed reference stream in the same region (IBI Metrics Table).</P>
