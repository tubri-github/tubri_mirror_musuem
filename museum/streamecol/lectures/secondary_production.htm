<P ALIGN="CENTER">SECONDARY PRODUCTION</P>
<P>Secondary production deals with biomass production through time by consumers and how energy flows through this portion of the food web. The focus of this discussion is on stream macroinvertebrates, but very similar methods would be used to estimate production by fishes. Animal production studies use a population approach, rather than a community approach as in studies of autotrophs and heterotrophic microbes.  This is because the organisms are larger, better known taxonomically and easier to quantify.</P>
<P>Secondary consumers ingest food (I), assimilate some of the food energy (A) and egest the rest (E). Thus,</P>
<EM><P>I = A + E</P>
</EM><P>A portion of assimilated food energy goes toward production (P), a portion is used in respiration (R) and a portion is lost to excretion (U). Thus,</P>
<EM><P>A = P + R + U</P>
</EM><P>Each of the parameters in these equations are fluxes (flows) of energy or carbon with units of energy/areatime. For an individual organism P represents growth; for a population it represents collective growth across all individuals. How much an individual grows or a population increases in mass (production efficiency, <EM>P/A</EM>) depends on how efficiently it assimilates food energy it ingests (<EM>A/I</EM>). Assimilation efficiency varies greatly for stream invertebrates: 5% for detritivores; 90% for carnivores. Net production efficiency shows less variation among trophic levels (~50% for both detritivores and carnivores). Thus, a carnivore might convert 45% (0.9 x 0.5) of its food to production, whereas a detritivore might convert only 2% (0.05 x 0.5) of its food to production. </P>
<EM><P>Biomass turnover</EM> </P>
<P>Production is not exactly the same as biomass. Biomass (<EM>B</EM>) is the amount of mass of animal tissue present at any one time or averaged over several periods of time. Units of biomass are mass per area (g/m<SUP>2</SUP>). Production (<EM>P</EM>) is the rate of production of mass. Its units are mass per areatime (gm<SUP>-2 </SUP>year<SUP>-1</SUP>). The ratio of production to biomass (<EM>P/B</EM>) gives a biomass turnover rate with units of inverse time.</P>
<P>To measure production, one need only gather quantitative data on a population at different points in time. One method involves following a particular cohort (all individuals born in a given reproductive season) through time. The cohort will likely be seen to decrease in number (N) over time due to mortality, and increase in individual mass (W) due to growth. Production over the interval can then be estimated as the sum of all interval estimates:</P>
<EM><P>P = N<SUB>(mean)</SUB>W</P>
</EM><P>This is referred to as the <EM>increment-summation method</EM>. An example calculation is given in Table 26.1.</P>
<P>Alternatively, if one cannot follow a population over time, non-cohort techniques can be used. One such method is called the <EM>size-frequency method.</EM> In this method, one assumes that the average size-frequency distribution determined from samples taken throughout the year approximates a mortality curve for an average cohort. One then measures the decrease in density (N) from one size class to the next and multiplies this by the difference in mean mass between size categories. Before summing, products must be multiplied by the number of size classes. An example is given in Table 26.2. </P></BODY>
