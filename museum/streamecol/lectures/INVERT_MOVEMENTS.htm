<P ALIGN="CENTER">MACROINVERTEBRATE MOVEMENTS</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Movement is the process of actively or passively being transported from one place to another. Colonization is the process of inhabiting a new area, or reinhabiting an area that was formerly inhabitated (recolonization). </P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>In lentic (standing water) habitats, organisms are free to move about in virtually any direction. In streams, the continuous flow of water favors downstream displacement and makes upstream movement difficult for organisms in an aquatic phase.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Four routes of colonization/movement are recognized: <EM>downstream movement; upstream movement;</EM> <EM>vertical movements;</EM> and <EM>aerial movements.</P>
</EM><P><BR>
</P>
<P>The most common direction of movement of organisms in streams is downstream movement, either by active crawling or (most commonly) by passive <EM>drift</EM>. Drift is the downstream movement of organisms by stream flow. The term is usually applied only to benthic macroinvertebrates. Drift occurs all the time, but is more common at night and has distinct diel peaks just after dusk and before dawn (Fig. 17.1). A wide variety of macroinvertebrates drift (insects, crustaceans, mollusks, annelids), but insects make up the largest portion. The fact that drift is constantly occurring means that downstream areas can be quickly recolonized following disturbances. </P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Stream invertebrates actively or passively enter drift. In the former case, changes in light levels trigger behaviors that result in organisms releasing themselves to the water column.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>A variety of explanations have been offered for why invertebrates drift (escape from predators or competitors, avoidance of unfavorable water), but the most logical explanation is dispersal. Drifting invertebrates are subject to predation by sight-feeding fish; this explains why it is more common at night.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Upstream movements are relatively unimportant because they are difficult to mount for most invertebrates. Freshwater mussels and leaches may be transported considerable distances upstream by fish and other vertebrates.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Vertical movements, particularly movements of invertebrates upstream from the hyporheic refugia, can be a very important means of recolonization following scouring floods.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Aerial movement is carried out only by the winged adult stages of aquatic insects. <EM>Adult emergence</EM> is an important mechanism of dispersal, not only to other areas within watersheds, but to other watersheds. It is hypothesized (established for some insects) that females routinely fly upstream for egg deposition to counter the predominant downstream displacement of larval stages due to drift. If generally true, this pattern of ovipositioning would establish a need for downstream drift of larval stages to relieve overcrowding. </P></BODY>
