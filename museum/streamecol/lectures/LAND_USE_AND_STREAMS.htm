<p align=center style='text-align:center'>LAND USE AND STREAMS</p>

<p>Mention was made early on that streams are formed from catchments that
include all of the land area surrounding the stream and its tributaries. The
stream and the land that feeds it are collectively referred to as a watershed,
and there are important linkages between these two components that influence
hydrology, temperature, energy and nutrient inputs to streams. This discussion
is about the impact of anthropogenic modification of land surrounding a stream
on the stream ecosystem.</p>

<p>Mentioned more recently that <span class=SpellE>channelization</span> of
streams was the most pervasive form of human <span class=SpellE>modication</span>
of streams. Impacts from land use changes are a very close second. Land cover
in watersheds is altered to differing degrees and intensities by humans, with differing
degrees of impacts on streams. Urbanization is the most intensive and has the
greatest impact. Certain types of forestry (e.g., selective cutting) are the
least intensive and impact streams the least. Agricultural land use (many forms
and intensities of land use within this) is intermediate between these other
types of land use, but is so widespread that it receives most of the attention.
</p>

<p>Modification of watersheds for agriculture involves removal of natural
vegetation and reshaping of the stream itself to improve drainage. In the
eastern <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
removal of natural vegetation usually involved deforestation, including forests
of the riparian zone, which are the most important to streams. In agricultural
states such as <st1:State><st1:place>Illinois</st1:place></st1:State>, it is no
almost impossible to image what the land and streams were like in their natural
state. Crops extend to the edges of very straight stream channels. There are
almost no trees.</p>

<p>Agricultural runoff is the main source of pollution of streams and other
aquatic habitats. The largest single <span class=SpellE>polluntant</span> is
soil eroded from the land. 80% of the 4.9 billion metric tons of soil eroded
from rural, non-federal land came from cropland. The second largest pollutant
is nutrients. Agricultural sources are responsible for half of the phosphorous
and nitrogen discharged to <st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
waterways. Because these <span class=SpellE>polluntants</span> originate over
large land areas, they are not traceable to a particular source (hence the name
<i>non-point source pollution</i>). </p>

<p>Agricultural land use in watersheds generally causes streams to become
shallower and more uniform in depth and substrate composition due to
sedimentation. Streams become warmer due to removal of canopy vegetation and
depth profile changes. They become more dependent on autochthonous (primary)
production (decreased <span class=SpellE>allochthonous</span> inputs of CPOM
from trees), and <span class=SpellE>hydrologically</span> more <span
class=SpellE>unpredicable</span> (fed more by runoff than <span class=SpellE>hyporheic</span>
flow). </p>

<p>In larger rivers, floodplains are altered by clearing of trees, draining and
filling in of back swamps, <span class=SpellE>leveeing</span> of the river to
prevent <span class=SpellE>overbank</span> flooding. Floodplains and lateral
aquatic habitats are critical to the ecology of large rivers. We have yet to
fully assess how reduction of these habitats has impacted large river ecosystems.
It is clear that the nutrients originating from agricultural and urban sources
are not being consumed while in transport, because excessive nutrient loading
is causing <span class=SpellE>eutrophication</span> and other problems in
coastal estuaries at the mouth of the <st1:State><st1:place>Mississippi</st1:place></st1:State>
and other large rivers.</p>

<p>Animal production is another form of agricultural land use that impacts
streams. In this case, natural forest or native grassland vegetation is
typically converted to common feed grasses, which are typically heavily
fertilized. Animals grazing on the land causes soil compaction. In cases where
land is overgrazed, grasses usually fail and soil erodes. Animal wastes are a
source of nutrients to streams draining animal lands. Stream receiving runoff
from chicken houses, hog farms, cattle feed lots, or slaughter yards are
heavily impacted.</p>

<p><span class=SpellE>Silviculture</span> (timber production) is generally
viewed as a less intensive form of land <span class=GramE>use,</span> however
forestry practices vary widely and can have dramatic impacts of streams. The
forest practices with the greatest impacts on streams are clear cutting and
road building. It is important to keep in mind that forestry today is usually
practiced in areas where the land is steeply sloped (low land forests were cut
long ago). Clear cutting clears forest from large areas of this land. The tree
cover not only protects the land from erosion, but also helps water to
penetrate the soil, plays a key role in the water cycle (<span class=SpellE>evapotranspiration</span>),
absorbs and reflects solar radiation (influencing ground temperature) and
contributes litter to the forest floor. Without this cover, the land is easily
eroded and subject to rapid water runoff, exposed to high solar heating, and
robbed of nutrients. Streams draining clear-cut land are subject to flash
flooding and complete drying in low water periods, heavy sedimentation, high
heating, and reduced food energy.</p>

<p>Forest road building on steep <span class=SpellE>hillslopes</span> often
leads to hillside failure. The roads often cut unnaturally across stream
drainage systems, and act themselves as conduits of runoff.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Stream crossings are culverts or pipes which
disrupt fish movements. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span></p>

<p>The general biological impact of agricultural and <span class=SpellE>silvicultural</span>
land use is reduced abundance and diversity of stream organisms due to reduced
and degraded <span class=SpellE>instream</span> habitat. </p>
