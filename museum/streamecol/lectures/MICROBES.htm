<P ALIGN="CENTER">HETEROTROPHIC MICROBES</P>
<P>The organisms we address in this section are microscopic decomposers and consumers that are part of a community associated with submerged surfaces such as rocks, leaves, wood, interstitial waters, and waters overlying the sediment surface. Included are microscopic bacteria, protists, and fungi. These organisms play an important role processing DOM and FBOM in streams. They organisms are in turn consumed by other stream organisms (<EM>meiofauna</EM>).</P>
<P>Benthic microbes remove dissolved organic material from the surface water and assimilate it, transferring it to biomass on/in the stream bottom. The presence and action of these organisms is documented by measuring the disappearance of DOM. Studies documenting DOM disappearance have revealed that some sources of DOM are removed more readily than others, suggesting differences in DOM quality. When we speak of the <EM>quality of organic matter</EM>, we are actually interested in the ability of organisms to use it as a food source. For heterotrophic microbes, DOM quality is measured as the metabolic response of microbes to different forms of DOM, i.e., leachate from different types of leaves (not well studied). </P>
<P>Heterotrophic microbial production changes seasonally due to changes in temperature and the availability and quality of DOM. In addition to bacteria, the heterotrophic microbial community includes particle consuming (<EM>phagotrophic</EM>) protists (Fig. 12.3). These single-celled eukaryotes - including some single celled algae (<EM>mixotrophs</EM>) - are also important consumers of bacteria (<EM>bacterivores</EM>). Thus, quantifying the protistan component of the benthic microbial community not only establishes the role protists play in total microbial heterotrophy, but also in bacterial production dynamics. Phagotrophs are more commonly associated with sediments than with the water column.</P>
<P>Heterotrophic activity consumes oxygen, and the most common method of measuring microbial community metabolism is to look at changes in oxygen concentration (respiration). Other approaches include use of redox dyes to estimate numbers of respiring organisms, radioisotopic techniques for estimating bacterial productivity ([<SUP>3</SUP>H] leucine), and use of settling chambers and fluorescence microscopy to enumerate preserved bacteria and protists. </P></BODY>
