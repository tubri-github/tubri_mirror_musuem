<p align=center style='text-align:center'>STREAM MODIFICATION: CHANNELIZATION</p>

<p>Humans have been modifying streams to suit their needs since the beginning
of human existence. Stream modification is a general term for any physical modification
of a stream by humans. The three main forms of stream modification are
impoundments, water removal or diversion, and <span class=SpellE>channelization</span>.</p>

<p><span class=SpellE>Channelization</span> is modification of a stream channel
to make it more uniform. It involves a number of different activities: channel
straightening, ditching or dredging, snagging, and <span class=SpellE>diking</span>.
It is done to decrease the lateral extent of streams and to increase flow
(thereby reducing flooding tendency). <span class=SpellE>Channelization</span>
is the most pervasive anthropogenic disturbance to streams. Virtually all
streams in eastern <st1:place>North America</st1:place> - from small creeks to
the largest rivers - have been <span class=SpellE>channelized</span> in some
way. </p>

<p><span class=SpellE>Channelization</span> simplifies the structure of the
channel by straightening the <span class=SpellE>mainstem</span>, reducing
meandering, and increasing the slope of the stream. This results in higher flow
velocities, higher <span class=SpellE>erosional</span> energy, and <span
class=SpellE>downcutting</span> of the channel. <span class=SpellE>Downcutting</span>
causes the stream to become entrenched (more confined to its <span
class=SpellE>mainstem</span>), thus preventing further meandering. The length of
the stream is generally reduced. Shorter stream length over the same upstream
to downstream elevation difference as before <span class=SpellE><span
class=GramE>channelization</span></span><span class=GramE>,</span> means an
increase in the stream gradient and flow velocity. The shorter length and
increased velocity impacts organic-matter processing, nutrient spiraling and
other important processes. Short, <span class=SpellE>channelized</span> reaches
also offer <span class=GramE>less habitat</span> for biota than longer, sinuous
stream reaches. </p>

<p>The unnatural channel configuration also does not dissipate energy as
efficiently. During high-flow conditions, <span class=SpellE>channelized</span>
reaches usually experience increased erosion and scouring of the bank.
Increased erosion and bank instability often result in increased suspended
sediment and bed load carried to downstream areas. <span class=GramE>Increased
sediment transport results in increased sedimentation downstream (<span
class=SpellE><i>aggradation</i></span>), which disturbs habitat and increases
flooding potential.</span> Turbidity is often higher in <span class=SpellE>channelized</span>
sections than natural stream reaches, which can have negative impacts on the primary
production, water quality, and food supply to stream organisms. </p>

<p>Altered stream velocities affect the sediment particle size distribution
along the stream bed. There is often a loss of organic materials, either from
their physical removal during channel dredging, or from increased water
velocities following <span class=SpellE>channelization</span>. Since the
channel configuration is more uniform, lacking pools, riffles, and other
diverse morphological characteristics, the substrate also tends to become more
uniform. The lack of structures to encourage trapping and deposition of
sediment also results in reduced habitat diversity. </p>

<p><span class=SpellE>Channelization</span> also lowers the water table in the
adjacent floodplain and reduces the exchange between <span class=SpellE>hyporheic</span>
and surface flow in the stream. As the stream velocity increases and <span
class=SpellE>downcutting</span> of the channel occurs, there is a resultant
lowering of the <span class=SpellE>mainstem</span> water table. Lowering of the
water table causes less water to be stored in the floodplain, which deprives
lateral habitats of their source of cool groundwater.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As groundwater drains out of the surrounding
land, the soil is compacted, further reducing the capacity of the soil to store
water. As the flow of groundwater into the stream is reduced, groundwater (<span
class=SpellE>hyporheic</span>) recharge from the stream is also reduced. </p>

<p>The disturbance associated with <span class=SpellE>channelization</span>
impacts fish and other stream life by reducing <span class=SpellE>instream</span>
and streamside vegetation; disrupting the riffle-pool sequence; reducing
overall stream length; increasing gradient and flow velocity; dewatering
adjacent lands; and changing the basic physicochemical regime. </p>

<p>A common feature of <span class=SpellE>channelization</span> is <i>snagging</i>
- the removal of tree stumps and other large woody debris. Studies indicate
that the presence of large woody debris in streams is one of the most important
factors regulating stream habitat diversity. Large tree falls obstruct stream
flow and allow for the trapping of coarse substrate above the obstruction
(e.g., gravels important to fish spawning) and scouring of the streambed
downstream of the obstruction, leading to pool development. Woody debris
provides cover and shelter for fish, and in some cases fish spawn in the log
cavities. Removal of large woody debris during <span class=SpellE>channelization</span>
can also <span class=GramE>reduces</span> invertebrate abundance and diversity.
</p>

<p>Riparian vegetation - the source of <span class=SpellE>instream</span> woody
debris - is typically removed when streams are <span class=SpellE>channelized</span>.
Removal of canopy vegetation reduces shading, resulting in increased stream
temperatures. Leaf supply may also be disrupted. The increased light may
stimulate greater primary productivity, however. Trees along a stream and their
root systems play an important role stabilizing the stream bank. When removed,
the banks become more susceptible to erosion. Removal of riparian vegetation
also reduces the ability of the floodplain to attenuate flood waters. </p>

<p>The combination of increased flow velocities and bank erosion causes more
fine sediment to be carried into the stream than the stream can handle, and <span
class=SpellE>instream</span> substrate to become more unstable. Loose and
shifting substrate prevents benthic invertebrate communities from becoming
established and reduces coarse spawning substrates for fishes. The increased
number of sediment particles in transit in the water has an abrasive effect on
the gills of fish and <span class=SpellE>macroinvertebrates</span>.
Interstitial spaces in the substratum become clogged, removing an important
retreat for <span class=SpellE>macroinvertebrates</span> from high current
velocities, as well as further reducing stability of the stream bed.</p>
