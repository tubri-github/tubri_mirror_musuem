<P ALIGN="CENTER">TEMPERATURE, LIGHT AND OXYGEN / HYPORHEIC FLOW</P>
<P>Sun is the ultimate source of heat and light in most aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. However, opportunities for direct heating and lighting by sun is limited in streams due to shading of riparian vegetation (small streams) or turbidity (large rivers). Oxygen is important to heterotrophic organisms in streams and in many chemical reactions key to how streams function. We will look at each of these parameters in turn. </P>
<EM><P>Temperature</P>
</EM><P>Considering shading and the fact that streams are fed by water from below ground level, one might think that they don't vary much in temperature over the course of a day (<EM>diel temperature flux</EM>). However, stream temperatures do tend to be warmer by day and lower at night, due ultimately to the warming action of solar radiation. The flux is not as great as in air because of the nature of streams and the <EM>high latent heat of water</EM>. </P>
<P>Stream temperatures can also vary from one habitat to another. This is particularly true of alluvial segments and stems from connections between channel and groundwater flows. Habitats receiving groundwater flows can be several degrees cooler in summer and warmer in winter.</P>
<EM><P>Light</P>
</EM><P>Light is important for photosynthesis in aquatic plants and visual behavioral activities of animals. Light penetration to streams is reduced by overhanging vegetation, steep canyon walls, and suspended material in the water (turbidity). </P>
<P>Bands of solar radiation that are of most importance to biota are in the 400 - 700 nm range, because this is range containing visual bands and bands utilized by autotrophs (<EM>photosynthetically active radiation</EM> or <EM>PAR</EM>). As a result of ozone depletion, bands of radiation in the ultraviolet range (e.g, UV-B radiation), which are harmful to plants and animals, are becoming more prevalent. </P>
<P>Light is measured in <I>photons</I>. The number of photons of light in the 400-700 nm range falling on a specific area per unit time is called the <EM>photon flux density</EM> (<EM>PFD</EM>). In a typical unshaded stream, PFD can reach 2000 umol/m<SUP>2 </SUP>s at midday. Seasonal variation in light falling on a stream results from changes in sun angle, day length, and phenological changes in stream-side vegetation (the latter can cause incident light to differ by two orders of magnitude in deciduous forests).</P>
<P>Spatial variability in PFD can also be also high, based on stream width, depth, proximity of a particular habitat to shore, canopy gaps, etc. As stream size increases, riparian vegetation shades progressively less of the stream channel. One of the biggest impacts of human disturbance in streams is removal of stream-side vegetation, so that even small streams receive large amounts of light.</P>
<EM><P>Oxygen</EM> </P>
<P>Oxygen is carried in water as a dissolved gas <EM>(dissolved oxygen </EM>or <EM>DO</EM>). The amount of water that dissolves depends on temperature (inverse relationship) and the amount of contact the water has with air (positive relationship with atmospheric pressure). Because streams flow (agitation causes lots of contact with air) streams are typically well saturated with DO (80% or more). Upwellings of interstitial waters of the hyporheic zone can cause considerable spacial variability in DO between habitats. </P>
<P>Biological activity can also cause spatial variability in DO. Microbial activity in leaf packs or debris dams lowers DO; dense vegetation increases DO by day. Organic enrichment is the biggest factor affecting DO in polluted streams because of increased <EM>biological oxygen demand</EM> (<EM>BOD</EM>).</P>
<P><BR>
<EM>Hyporheic zones</P>
</EM><P>Hyporheic zone is zone where water flows through substrata (interstitial environment) below the streambed. It is a surface-water/ground-water transition zone or ecotone. It is physically different from the surface water (in terms of temperature, light, DO), and it is an important, yet poorly understood, habitat for a wide variety of organisms. For many streams, hyporheic invertebrate production exceeds that of the surface waters.  Upwellings from the hyporheic zone deliver limiting nutrients to surface waters. </P></BODY>
