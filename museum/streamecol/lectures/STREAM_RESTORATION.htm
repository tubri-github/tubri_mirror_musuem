<P ALIGN="CENTER">STREAM RESTORATION</P>

<P>Streams receive surprisingly little protection from conservation laws. The Clean water Act has had some success reducing pollution in the largest rivers.  The Endangered Species Act has had limited success protecting streams that harbor rare fishes.  The Wild and Scenic Rivers Act and a number of similar state laws protect segments of rivers, but rarely entire river systems. Scenic rivers are often damaged by excessive recreational use!</P>
<P>The stream systems that receive the highest degree of protection are those that are contained within forest reserves or state or federal wilderness areas.  However, these are terrestrial reserves designed to protect forests and terrestrial animals.  A system of stream reserves is needed to ensure that a sufficient number of streams and the biota they support are protected.  </P>

<P>The Nature Conservancy recently completed a national assessment of the degree of imperilment of freshwater biodiversity in the United States.  After mapping at-risk populations of fish and mussels in more than 2000 small watersheds in the United States (most in the southeast), the Nature Conservancy concluded that 327 watersheds - 15% of the total - would need to be protected in order to protect all of the imperiled fish and mussel species.  Since fewer than 15% of the watersheds in the U.S. are pristine and under protection, the issue of conserving stream biodiversity boils down to restoring some of the streams and watersheds that are currently impacted by anthropogenic activity.       </P>

<P>Fortunately stream ecosystems have great powers of recuperation.  Recovery times vary, depending on the type and extent of disturbance.   Humans can accelerate the recovery process if they have the will, and the proper understanding of the natural dynamics of streams and the forces causing the disturbance.  It is important to realize that the goal of stream restoration is rarely to halt human activities affecting streams, but rather to minimize the impact of those activities on the stream and to restore the stream to a more natural state.</P>

<P>Streams that have been channelized by activities such as dredging, channel straightening, snagging, cut offs, diking, etc, generally become entrenched in a particular portion of the flood plain.  Rock wiers can sometimes be used to restrict flow to entrenched channels and force streams to return to abandoned secondary channels on the floodplain.  However, extensive channel re-engineering is expensive and rarely has the desired effect. </P>

<P>A key feature governing interactions between streams and the surrounding land in forested watersheds is the degree of forestation of the riparian zone.  Maintaining a strip of forest buffer of at least 100 meters on both sides of the stream is generally effective for trapping sediment eroding from cropland and forest clearcuts.  Wider forest buffers are generally needed to ensure that sufficient water enters the stream has hyporheic flow.  Thus, an important aspect of stream restoration in agricultural and silvicultural lands is restoring a forest buffer zone.  Another important aspect of restoring streams in these lands is encouraging Best Management Practices (BMP's).  In agricultural lands, BMPs include no-till farming, no planting on marginal lands, establishing ponds or marshes to trap fertilizers and animal wastes.  In silvicultural lands, BMP's include selective cutting or cutting on a rotation that allows forest regeneration, and care in the construction and use of forest roads.   </P>

<P>A key aspect of restoring larger rivers is moving people out of floodplains and allowing the rivers to once again flood and meander across their valleys.  </P>

<P>Dam removal is being advocated on many small streams and rivers.  Dams are not likely to be removed on the largest rivers, especially where hydropower production is involved.  However, water can be released in ways that are more in line with the natural flow dynamics of the river.   </P>

<P>Ordinary citizens are becoming increasingly conscience of environmental quality in general and stream quality in particular.  The streams that have the most vocal protectors and that have consequently received the most attention are trout streams.  However, it is warm-water streams that are the most impacted by anthropogenic activity and need the most protection. A number of non-governmental organizations are devoted to protection of streams.  Some of the most important national organizations are American Rivers, River Revival, the Nature Conservancy, Sierra Club, and Trout Unlimited.  </P>
