<P ALIGN="CENTER">SOLUTES AND NUTRIENTS</P>
<P><BR>
This lecture deals with chemicals dissolved in water (<EM>solutes</EM>). The kinds of chemicals include chloride ion, calcium, sodium, potassium, magnesium, silica, carbonate (all of which tend to dissolve in relatively high concentrations in streams) and phosphate and nitrate (which tend to occur at very low concentrations - <EM>are limiting</EM> - in streams). We have already talked about oxygen, which occurs as a dissolved gas. </P>
<P>Water is referred to as a <EM>universal solvent</EM>, because almost anything dissolves in it. In fact water dissolves some chemicals so well that it is hard to purify.</P>
<P>Solutes in stream water come from the atmosphere (i.e., washed out by rain - chloride, sodium, sulfate, nitrogen, carbon dioxide); soil and rock (calcium, phosphate, silica, magnesium); and biological activity (nitrate, different forms of carbon). </P>
<P>Solute dynamics refers to the spatial and temporal cycling of solutes between abiotic and biotic components of the ecosystem. In a lake, solute and nutrient cycling occurs in the same general vicinity as the solute origin. In streams, cycling is drawn out longitudinally (as with a spiral) due to the flow of the river, so that a solute may cycle in or out of the stream at a place different (downstream) from where it entered (<I>nutrient spiraling</I>).</P>
<P>Solutes may be beneficial to living organism, in which case they are called nutrients, or harmful, in which case they are called toxins (heavy metals). If biotic or abiotic processes change the concentration of solutes they are called <EM>nonconservative </EM>(e.g., nitrate, phosphate, calcium). If their concentration is not changed by instream processes they are called <I>conservative</I> (e.g., lithium, which does not react chemically with water, and chloride, which occurs far in excess of biological need).</P>
<P>Conservative solutes exhibit simple dynamics, being moved about by diffusion or turbulence (<EM>dispersion</EM>) and downstream transport at water velocity (<EM>advection).</EM> Change in concentration of these solutes over time can be determined simply by factoring the combined effects of water velocity (downstream displacement) and dispersion on solute concentration. One can envision solutes being temporarily stored in water (<EM>transient storage</EM>) that is moving more slowly than the main body of water (e.g., a backwater).</P>
<P>Measuring the dynamics of nonconservative solutes is more difficult, because in addition to being moved about the stream, they are being exchanged with the substrate and with organisms. When solutes are removed from the water column by either biotic or abiotic processes, we say they are <EM>immobilized</EM>. </P>
<P>Another way of looking at the cycling of nonconservative solutes is in terms of <I>spiraling length</I> - the distance downstream a particular solute travels while completing a cycle. Spiraling length has an abiotic component (distance traveled while dissolved in water, a.k.a. <EM>uptake length</EM>) and a biotic component (distance traveled before being remobilized, a.k.a. <I>turnover length</I>).</P>
<P>Some nonconservative solutes are very active, and tend to be readily immobilized. Phosphorus is the best example of this. It is readily taken up by benthic organisms such as algae, bacteria, fungi, and meiofauna. It tends to occur in organisms in similar proportions as it does in river water. Because of its importance to benthic algae and its limited supply, it is the nutrient most likely to limit primary production in freshwater ecosystems. Organisms in turn serve as an important sink for phosphorus.</P>
<P>Plant cells growing under nutrient-saturated conditions tend to have C, N and P in a molar ratio of 106:16:1 (<EM>Redfield ratio</EM>). Plant cells are said to be phosphorus deficient when C:P ratio exceeds 129 and N:P ratio exceeds 22.</P>
<P>Some of the ways phosphorus limitation is measured in stream is with enrichment bioassays (where the stream is fertilized and the biotic response measured) or by looking at phosphatase activity in plants.</P>
<P>The relationship between nutrient (phosphorus) concentration and nutrient uptake is hyperbolic. This is because nutrient uptake becomes saturated as nutrient concentration increases. K<SUB>s</SUB> - the half-saturation constant - is the nutrient concentration at which uptake is half the maximum. This is a useful index of a cell's affinity for nutrient: a low K<SUB>s</SUB> suggests a higher affinity for the nutrient. Organisms with low K<SUB>s</SUB> tend to have a competitive advantage at low nutrient concentration. </P></BODY>
