<p align=center style='text-align:center'>STREAM VALLEY AND CHANNEL UNITS</p>

<p>Last time we considered general physical attributes of catchment basins,
concluding with a discussion of the dimensionality of streams. I mentioned that
there are physical, chemical and biotic gradients along each dimension, with
gradual changes in conditions (continua) along each gradient.</p>

<p>We now take a more detailed look at the physical habitats occurring within a
stream system, examining the different types of valley segments, stream reaches
and channel geomorphic units typically recognized. As with any classification
system, what we are doing in classifying stream habitats this way is collapsing
the complexity and variety of nature into a limited number of categories.
However, the categories do have some basis in reality because they represent
common responses of the landscape to the physical forces of water flowing
through a catchment system.</p>

<p>Authors of text make the point that the practice of classifying stream
habitats based on hydrological and geomorphic factors is relatively new and
still undergoing refinement. They present two classifications schemes: one
focused at the level of valley segments and stream reaches; and the other
focused at the level of channel geomorphic units.</p>

<p><i>Valley Segments<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p>A <i>valley</i> - one of the two main subdivisions of watersheds (catchment
basins) - is the area where water and sediment collect and within which the
stream resides. Three different valley-segment types are recognized based on
sediment input and transport mechanisms: <em>colluvial, alluvial </em>and<em>
bedrock</em>. A colluvial valley segment is an uncommon valley type in which
the valley floor is filled with material delivered by mass wasting of
hillslopes (e.g., landslides). Alluvial valley segments are valleys filled by
sediment transported by stream flow (the material tends to be more mobile).
Bedrock valley segments are dominated by bedrock, with very little sediment. </p>

<p>Valley segments are said to be <em>supply-limited (more or less) depending
on the amount of sediment delivered to them, and transport-limited (more or
less) </em>depending on the ability of water to move sediment within the
valley. Bedrock valley segments have very little sediment in them to begin with,
and thus tend to be very supply limited. <span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"> </span>Any sediment delivered is quickly swept away (not transport
limited). Water flowing through colluvial valleys is generally ineffective at
removing accumulated sediment. Thus, colluvial valleys are transport limited.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Alluvial valleys are intermediate between these
two extremes.</p>

<p><i>Channel reaches<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p>Channel reaches are relatively homogeneous sections of stream within valley
segments. Colluvial valleys have only colluvial reaches; bedrock valleys have
only bedrock reaches. However, six different reach types may be seen within
alluvial valleys, varying from more supply-limited to more transport-limited
extremes, and the boundaries between different reach types are seldom distinct.</p>

<p>The most supply-limited reach types in alluvial valleys are <em>cascade </em>and
<em>step-pool</em> reaches. In cascades, particle sizes are large (ensuring
limited substrate mobilization) and hydraulic jumps may be high (waterfalls).
In step-pool reaches, steps consisting of accumulations of boulders and/or
large woody debris, alternate with pools containing finer substrates. </p>

<p><i>Plane-bed</i> and <i>R<em>iffle-pool</em></i> reaches are intermediate in
terms of the transport/supply-limited continuum, gradient and bed roughness.
Plane-bed reaches are characterized by long straight channels of uniform depth.
Substrates tend to be uniform, typically with larger cobbles forming a layer of
armoring over finer substrates. Riffle/pool reaches are lower in gradient, more
variable in terms of depth and substrate composition, and more sinuous in
channel form than plane-bed reaches. Riffle/pool reaches become more uniform in
high flows. </p>

<p><i>Regime</i> and <em>braided reaches</em> tend to have the lowest
gradients, the finest substrates and the most sinuous (meandering) channel
patterns of all alluvial valley reach types. They are typically seen in high
order streams. Sediment transport is continuous, and the banks typically are
easily eroded. Channel switching is common.</p>

<p><i>Channel geomorphic units<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p>Channel geomorphic units - also referred to as channel units or habitats -
are the smallest of the three units considered here. They tend to be
homogeneous and discretely different in depth, current velocity and substrate
composition from adjoining units. They are most readily distinguished at low
stream flows. </p>

<p>Hawkins et al. (1993) proposed a three-tier system of channel unit
classification. The first level distinguishes <em>fast-water</em> from <em>slow
water</em> units. Fast water habitats are then subdivided into those with <em>turbulent
</em>and<em> non-turbulent flows</em>. Slow-water units (pools) are subdivided
into those formed by <em>scour</em> and those formed by <em>dams</em>. </p>

<p>Five types of turbulent (air-bubble entraining) fast-water habitats are
recognized depending on gradient, bed roughness, current velocity, and number
of hydraulic steps. The types are <em>falls</em>, <em>cascades</em>, <em>chutes</em>,
<em>rapids</em> and <em>riffles. </em>Falls are areas of steep vertical drops;
whereas cascades have shorter and more stepped drops. Chutes are narrow
channels slotted in bedrock. Rapids have relatively steep gradients, but tend
to be more planar than cascades. Finally riffles are the lowest gradient of the
fast-water habitats and tend to be confined to plane-bed and lower gradient
reaches. </p>

<p>Nonturbulent, fast water units are of two types: <em>sheet channels</em> and
<em>runs</em>. Sheet channels are areas where shallow water flows over
relatively smooth, flat bedrock. They are seen only in bedrock-dominated
reaches. Runs are similar but differ in having sand or gravel substrates.</p>

<p>Among slow-water habitats are a number of types of <i>scour pools</i> (<em>eddy</em>,
<em>trench</em>, <em>mid-channel</em>, <em>convergence</em>, <em>lateral</em>,
and <em>plunge</em>) and <i>impoundment pools</i> (<em>debris dams</em>, <em>beaver
dams</em>, <em>landslide dams</em>, <em>backwaters</em>, and <em>abandoned
channels</em>). Eddy pools form behind large objects. Trench pools are slow
flowing chutes. Mid-channel pools form in areas of flow constriction due to
hardened banks or other obstructions. Convergence pools form at the convergence
of two streams of equal size. Lateral scour pools form where the stream
encounters a resistant stream bank (e.g., outcrop or rip rap). Plunge pools
form at the base of a waterfall or cascade. </p>

<p>Dammed pools form upstream of dams. <i>Debris dam pools</i> are dams formed
above log jams or piles of debris that happen to clog the streams. <i>Beaver
dam pools</i> form above debris dams deliberately constructed by beaver<i>.
Landslide pools</i> form when a hillslope fails and blocks stream flow. <i>Backwaters</i>
or side channels are found beside the main stream channel, and represent
secondary channels that are connected to the stream only at the downstream end.
<i>Abandoned channels</i> are former channels that no longer have any
connection to the main channel.</p>
