<p align=center style='text-align:center'><b>FISH COMMUNITY COMPOSITION<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p>Fishes are perhaps the most obvious component of the stream biota. They are
certainly the dominant organisms in terms of size, and seem to dominate biomass
in many streams as well. </p>

<p>Just as with invertebrates, ecologists think of stream fishes as organized
in communities - a group of species inhabiting a prescribed area and interacting
with each other and other groups of organisms in some important way. It is
common practice (though completely unnatural) to study stream fish communities
as separate from other components of stream biota (stream fish community
ecology).</p>

<p>As with invertebrates, stream fish communities have emergent properties of
richness (the number of species present in the community), diversity (a broader
concept that includes numbers and relative abundances of species), and
complexity of trophic and other functional roles. Studies of stream fish
communities have two basic steps: description of the community (community
composition) and community processes and interactions. Most of this discussion
deals with the first of these steps.</p>

<p>The composition of any community is determined a combination of historical
and ecological processes. Historical processes, such as speciation and
dispersal of species from one region to another, represent first-order
determinants of community composition because they determine the size of the
pool of available species a particular local community is drawn from. These
events are influenced by geological (orogeny), climatic (glaciation, sea level
rise or fall) and hydrological (drainage changes) activities. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ecological processes, such as physiological tolerances of species,
environmental disturbance, interspecific competition and other forms of
biological interaction, represent second-order determinants of community
composition, because they influence (limit) the number of species a particular area
can support. An important assumption in this line of reasoning is that there is
a limit on the number of species an area can support, based on space and
available resources, and the adaptations of species. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It has long been demonstrated that stream fish diversity increases from
headwaters to mouth in streams, and that species are generally added to
communties rather than replaced (<i>longitudinal zonation</i>). Small streams
are generally considered harsh, unpredictable environments for stream fishes
because they are temporally variable and prone to extremes of flow (floods and
droughts). Disturbance is thus thought to be an important factor limiting fish
diversity in small streams. Large streams are more stable and predictable
environments than small streams, and are thus expected to support more species.
Many studies have shown that stream fish diversity increases as a function of
habitat complexity and habitat depth or volume. Large streams generally offer a
larger variety of habitats and more habitat volume than small streams, and are
thought to support more species for this reason. The notion here is that the
greater the variety of habitats an area has, the more species it can support. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The above relationships are well established and useful for understanding
diversity variation within stream systems. However, disturbance and habitat
complexity variation alone are not sufficient to explain fish diversity
differences among stream systems.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Warm-water streams of the eastern United States have a particular taxonomic
composition. They tend to be dominated by minnows (family Cyprinidae) and have
high representation of sunfishes (family Centrarchidae), darters (family
Percidae), catfishes (family Ictaluridae), and suckers (family Catostomidae).
Minnows, suckers, and catfishes are members of a group of fishes
(ostariophysans) that dominate freshwater communities around the world. Darters
and sunfishes are more recently evolved descendants of acanthomorph marine
fishes, but rival ostariophysans in diversity in the eastern United States.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Composition of stream fish communities can be characterized in terms of
functional and trophic roles. Some stream fishes are bottom-oriented (benthic),
some pelagic (nektonic), others surface-oriented (neustonic). Some have
strictly herbivorous diets, feeding on stream algae (e.g., stonerollers). Some
feed on insect larvae (insectivores), straining them from bottom sediments or
picking them from the water column (drift). Some feed on benthic
macroinvertebrates (insects, crustaceans, clams, snails); others feed primarily
on other fishes (piscivores). The relative proportions of different functional
and trophic groups vary based on environmental conditions. </p>
