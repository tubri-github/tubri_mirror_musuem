<p align=center style='text-align:center'>PREDATOR-PREY INTERACTIONS</p>

<p>Predation-prey interactions are typically viewed as <em>secondary
consumption</em> (animals eating other animals). Predator-prey theory deals with
the impact of predators on prey populations and prey community composition. The
central question is: Can predators influence the structure of prey
populations/communities? Most predator-prey theory was developed for closed,
equilibrium systems. Streams are a patchwork of open, <span class=SpellE>nonequilibrium</span>
habitats (riffles, pools) connected by migration. At the habitat patch scale,
the question is: How does predation in the patch influence prey population/
community composition within the patch? At this scale, predators are <i>not</i>
thought of as capable of structuring prey populations/communities. Models
developed for these systems (e.g., Caswell 1978) predict coexistence of
predator and prey populations for long periods of time, but suggest that
predators can have a major structuring influence.</p>

<p>The effects of predators on prey populations depend on the predation rate
and its relationship to <em>prey exchange rate</em> (rate at which prey move in
and out of areas where predators are feeding. In stream reaches where
background rates of prey migration are high (high drift rates), the effects of
predation may be swamped by prey immigration. Where background migration rates
are low, or where predators induce high rates of prey emigration, the impacts
of predators are more easily substantiated. Similarly, the impact of predators
on different prey species may vary depending on relative prey vulnerability,
background migration, and tendency of prey to emigrate from patches where
predators are foraging.</p>

<p>The effects of predators and prey can extend well beyond direct,
predator-induced mortality. Predators can have indirect, community-level
effects such as top-down effects or <span class=SpellE>trophic</span> cascades
(predators effects community composition below the level of their prey), and <span
class=SpellE>nonlethal</span> effects that affect prey fitness, such as where
predator avoidance by prey causes non-ideal feeding, or shifts to unfavorable
habitats. </p>

<p>The mechanisms or specific causes of predator effects on prey communities
often depend on whether predators are selective (i.e., consumption of a certain
type of prey is out of proportion to the prey's density in the environment).
Understanding these mechanisms is the purview of behavioral and evolutionary
ecology. Selective predation may result from concentration of predator search in
a preferred prey habitat, active rejection of certain types of prey, or
differential prey vulnerability. Selection that occurs because of predator
rejection is a function of predator choice (<em>active behavioral selection</em>);
selection that occurs because of differential vulnerability is more a function
of stereotypical predator behavior (<em>fixed behavioral selection</em>), prey
defenses (<em>passive selection</em>), or microhabitat differences among prey
that affect vulnerability.</p>

<p>A study by <span class=SpellE>Sih</span> and <st1:City><st1:place>Wooster</st1:place></st1:City>
(1994) examined the relationship of prey behavior and prey dispersal on
predator impacts in streams. Previous model suggested that prey exchange
(movement of prey among habitat patches) reduces predator impact on prey
density. However, the model included two assumptions that influenced its
qualitative predictions: 1) it assumed that the surrounding environment had no
predators and constant prey density; 2) it assumed that prey do not alter their
per capita emigration rates in response to the presence of predators. <span
class=SpellE>Sih</span> and <st1:City><st1:place>Wooster</st1:place></st1:City>
sought to refine the model by considering the impacts of these assumptions
(relaxing them and examining the effects). </p>

<p>They found that prey emigration behavior had a profound effect on the
relationship between prey exchange and predator impact. If prey do not alter
their emigration rates in response to predators, then high prey exchange rates
result in low predator impact (as predicted by the previous model). However, if
prey disperse out of patches in response to predators, then even very high prey
exchange rates cannot swamp predator impact (in fact, prey emigration adds to
predator impact). <span class=GramE>If predators force prey to hide (thereby
suppressing prey emigration), then high prey exchange can result in
&quot;negative predator impacts&quot; (higher prey density in patches with
predators).</span> </p>

<p>Invertebrate predators (stoneflies) tended to have stronger effects on prey
(always reducing prey density) than vertebrate predators (effects mixed).
Studies suggest that invertebrate predators decrease prey density mostly by increasing
invertebrate drift rates; whereas, vertebrates (fish) tend to decrease prey
activity (thereby limiting prey response). Drift makes prey less vulnerable to
invertebrate predators (benthic, tactile feeders), but more vulnerable to fish
(sight feeders). This causes what <span class=SpellE>Sih</span> and <st1:City><st1:place>Wooster</st1:place></st1:City>
called a &quot;paradox of danger&quot;, wherein more dangerous predators (fish)
have weaker impacts on prey populations than less dangerous predators
(invertebrates). </p>

<p>Predator-prey interactions often lead to evolution of a complex array of
prey defenses. A study by <span class=SpellE>Crowl</span> and <span
class=SpellE>Covich</span> (1990) showed that the widely distributed <span
class=SpellE>pulmonate</span> snail <span class=SpellE><i>Physella</i></span><i>
<span class=SpellE>virgata</span></i> changed its life history in response to
the presence of a crayfish predator, <span class=SpellE><i>Orconectes</i></span><i>
<span class=SpellE>virilis</span></i>. The changes were apparently initiated by
a water-borne cue released when crayfish fed on the snails. In the presence of
the cue, snails exhibited rapid growth and delayed reproduction 8 months until
they reached a size of about 10 mm. In the absence of the cue, snails
reproduced after only 3.5 months at a size of 4 mm. The chemically induced
shift indicates that life history of the snail is <span class=SpellE>phenotypically</span>
plastic. Snails were apparently able to reduce predation pressure by increasing
age and size at maturity.</p>
