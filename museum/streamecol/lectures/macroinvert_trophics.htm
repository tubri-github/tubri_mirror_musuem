<P ALIGN="CENTER">MACROINVERTEBRATE TROPHIC RELATIONSHIPS</P>
<P>Stream macroinvertebrates do not lend themselves very well to simple trophic level analysis. This is because they tend to consume a variety of plant, animal and microbial foods in the course of a typical feeding. For example, a snail that feeds by scraping algae from rocks, also consumes microbes, meiofauna, and early instars of certain insects. However, because of the prevalence of periphyton in streams, "scraping" is a popular functional mode of feeding, exhibited by a variety of macroinvertebrates. In fact, the nature of food energy inputs to streams, and food production deriving from those inputs, are such that stream macroinvertebrates have evolved a limited set of morphological and behavorial adaptations for utilizing these resources (convergent evolution). Periphyton scraping mouth parts are seen in a variety of caddisfly, mayfly and beetle larvae (not to mention the stoneroller). </P>
<P>Stream ecologists have found it more useful to classify trophic relationships of macroinvertebrates based on the mechanism of food acquisition, than on the type of food eaten. The <EM>functional feeding group</EM> classification of Cummins and Merritt is based on feeding mode. The classification recognizes four basic categories of food in stream ecosystems (CPOM, FPOM, periphyton, and prey), and four basic types of macroinvertebrate feeding modes designed to utilize each of these food types (shredders, collectors, scapers, and predators). The classification is presented below. </P>

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">FUNCTIONAL FEEDING GROUPS</H2>
<B><BLOCKQUOTE>Shredders:</B> food particle sizes &gt; 10<SUP>3</SUP> microns; all are chewers or miners on living plants or decomposing leaf and woody debris (CPOM).</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B><BLOCKQUOTE>Collector/Gatherers</B>: particle sizes &lt; 10<SUP>3</SUP> microns; includes filter or suspension feeders that feed on living algae and detritus, plus deposit feeders that feed on fine particles deposited in sediment.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B><BLOCKQUOTE>Scrapers:</B> particle sizes &lt; 10<SUP>3</SUP> microns; includes mineral scrapers (herbivores that feed on periphyton associated with rocks) and organic scrapers (herbivores that feed on periphyton associated with wood).</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B><BLOCKQUOTE>Predators:</B> particle sizes &gt; 10<SUP>3</SUP> microns; includes engulfers or swallowers (carnivores that eat animals whole or in large parts), and piercers (carnivores that feeding on cells or tissue fluids).</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Use of this approach allows an assessment (numerical or by standing biomass) of the degree to which macroinvertebrates depend on a particular food resource. It also makes apparent the relationship between food resources and the adaptations of organisms that utilize those resources. Moreover, as we have seen, the relative importance of different food resources changes from headwaters to mouth in streams. The functional feeding groups classification is sensitive to these changes, allowing stream ecologists to understand relationships under both natural and disturbed conditions.</P>
<P>Ratios of various functional feeding groups are useful indicators of the relative importance of autotrophy vs. heterotrophy, ratios and sizes of CPOM/FPOM, whether FPOM is predominantly in transport or in storage, and stream channel stability. Examples of these relationships for a heavily-shaded stream in the Allegheny National Forest in Pennsylvania can be viewed in Table 21.4. The shaded nature of the stream is reflected in the low numbers and biomass of scrapers. The stream is distinctly heterotrophic and dependent on allochthonous organic matter from the riparian zone (dominance of shredders and collectors). The large numbers of shredders indicate that the system is a "summer shredder stream", dependent on litter with a long <EM>conditioning time </EM>(time it takes litter to be sufficiently colonized by stream microbes, which render it useable by shredders). The abundance of filtering collectors relative to gathering collectors indicates that a significant amount of FPOM is in transport. The high ratio of scrapers + filtering collectors to shredders + gathering collectors indicates that the channel is stable (plenty of stable attachment surface available). Predator abundance is in balance with prey. A higher ratio would signal high predation and likelihood of dominance of prey with short life cycles and high turn over rates (decreased prey diversity). </P>
