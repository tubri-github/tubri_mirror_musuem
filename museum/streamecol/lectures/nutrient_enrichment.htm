<p align=center style='text-align:center'>NUTRIENT ENRICHMENT</p>

<p>Most ecosystems respond to nutrient addition with increased production,
suggesting that they are nutrient limited. In standing-water (<span
class=SpellE>lentic</span>) habitats, excessive nutrient loading causes the
system to become <span class=SpellE>eutrophic</span>: biological production
becomes so excessive that it deprives water of needed oxygen. </p>

<p>Streams typically are not thought of as high-oxygen, nutrient-limited
systems. Dissolved nutrient concentrations are typically very low in pristine
streams. However, the levels are probably sufficient for stream <span
class=SpellE>autotrophs</span> because the flowing water means constant
replenishment of nutrients. What happens when we add nutrients to streams in
excess of ambient levels? </p>

<p>The focus of this discussion will be on approaches to studying effects of
nutrient enrichment on <span class=SpellE>periphyton</span> production, because
this is the component of the stream biota that is most sensitive to nutrient
dynamics. </p>

<p>A number of different approaches are used to assess nutrient regulation of <span
class=SpellE>periphyton</span> production in streams. We will consider four approaches:
1) <em>in situ</em> nutrient manipulation; 2) enrichment of flow through
enclosures; 3) whole-stream manipulations; and 4) integrated bioassays. The
different approaches represent different spatial scales, and different degrees
of controlled experimentation versus natural system response. </p>

<p><i>In situ</i> nutrient manipulation involves deploying nutrient-rich
substrata and measuring <span class=SpellE>periphyton</span> growth response <em>in
stream</em> (nutrient rich substrata design figure)<em>. </em>Substrata are typically
dishes filled with sterile sand and/or agar enriched with nitrate, phosphate,
both, or nothing (control). Ideally, the substrata should simulate
nutrient-diffusing action of certain natural stream substrates (e.g., <span
class=SpellE>chironomid</span>-dwelling tubes in sand). <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>After a prescribed length of time, the dishes
are collected and <span class=SpellE>periphyton</span> growth is measured by oxidizing
the substrates and measuring AFDM. </p>

<p>Another approach involves use of flow-through enclosures (flumes). The
enclosures are pipes filled with natural or artificial substrates with open or
closed bottoms that are placed either in the streambed parallel to the flow, or
beside the stream with pumped stream flow (flow through design figure).
Nutrients are dripped in as water flows through. After the experiment has run
its course, the substrates are collected and <span class=SpellE>periphyton</span>
growth in nutrient treatments is compared to that in controls.</p>

<p>Whole-stream manipulations involve adding nutrients to the whole stream and
measuring the response of <span class=SpellE>periphyton</span> growth on
ceramic tiles placed upstream and downstream of the nutrient entry point. This
approach has the advantage of being the most natural, but the disadvantage of
being the most difficult to control.</p>

<p>The integrated approach simply involves combining different approaches. This
allows for comparison of nutrient effects across different scales.</p>

<p>As mentioned, streams are naturally nutrient-limited and tend to be oxygen
saturated. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Thus, they have a natural capacity
to endure a fair amount of nutrient loading.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>However, anthropogenic nutrient addition - especially around urban and
agricultural areas - can be so excessive that it quickly exhausts the natural buffering
capacity of streams, resulting in <span class=SpellE>eutrophication</span>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Phosphorus addition tends to be highest
around urban areas and row-crop agricultural areas.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Nitrogen addition is highest around animal
production and sewerage treatment plants. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Excess nutrients cause biomass and biological
oxygen demand to increase.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>DO decreases
to point where it favors certain “tolerant” <span class=SpellE>macrofauna</span>
(inverts such as black flies and <span class=SpellE>chironomids</span>, fish
such as bluegill and <span class=SpellE>mosquitofish</span>). Algal communities
become dominated by unpalatable blue-green algae. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Harmful bacteria increase to levels where they
are harmful to biota.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Eventually, the
stream reach receiving the nutrients effectively dies.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Conditions improve with distance from
pollution source. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span><span
