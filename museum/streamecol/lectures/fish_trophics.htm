<P ALIGN="CENTER">FISH TROPHIC RELATIONSHIPS</P>
<P>Stream macroinvertebrates classify neatly into functional feeding groups because of the nature of food resources at the base of the food chain in streams. Does the same relationship hold for stream fishes?</P>
<P>Herbivory (periphyton eating) and detritivory are not common modes of feeding in stream fishes. Species that exhibit these feeding strategies can account for a large amount of fish biomass, however. A number of "herbivorous" fishes are actually omnivores that consume invertebrates at the same time they are eating periphyton. </P>
<P>There are no parallels to shredders and collectors among fishes. In fact, the vast majority of fish species are macroinvertivores (analogous to predators among macroinvertebrates). They depend on all of the scraping, collecting, shredding, and predatory invertebrates. Most of the feeding specializations in fishes involve adaptations for catching invertebrate prey. </P>
<P>Most stream invertebrates are substrate oriented. Stream fishes are more dependent on the water column (active swimmers). Fish macroinvertivores can be subdivided into bottom (benthic) feeders, midwater (nekton) feeders, and surface (neuston) feeders. Mouth position is a good clue to feeding strategy in fishes.  As a genera rule, bottom feeders have downwardly directed (subterminal or inferior) mouths, which open below the tip of the snout.  Midwater feeders have terminal mouths, which end at the tip of the snout.   Surface feeders have superior mouths, which are distinctly upturned. </P>
<P>Bottom feeders can be further subdivided into epibenthic feeders, which consume invertebrates from the top layer of substrate, and infaunal benthic invertivores, which mine invertebrates from sediments.  Most infaunal benthose feeders strain invertebrates from fine sediments such as sand and silts. Suckers are the dominant group. Suckers suck up bottom sediments and water and flush them through their gills. The inner surfaces of the gill bars are modified for retaining the inverterbrates, while the water and most of the suspended passes through the gills. These fishes ingest a fair amount of sediment in their diets.</P>
<P>Epibenthic invertivores pick invertebrates from the substrate surface. The dominant groups are darters, catfishes, sculpins, sunfishes, and certain bottom oriented minnows. They tend to have highly mobile jaws and eyes. Some have narrow mouths for picking invertebrates from between crevices. A few actually flip stones to locate invertebrates. </P>
<P>Nekton feeders feed primarily on drift. Minnows are the dominant group that use this strategy.  Sunfishes and the young stages of practically all stream fishes consume zooplankton and other small macroinvertebrates found in slack water areas. </P>
<P>Neuston feeders exhibit a variety of adaptations for living close to the surface, such as flattened heads and rear set dorsal fins. They feed on spiders, waterstriders, and other insects that live in the surface tension, and terrestrial invertebrates that fall or are washed into the stream from the surrounding land. </P>
<P>The other feeding mode seen in stream fishes is piscivory (fish eating). True piscivory (year round fish eating) is exhibited by a relatively small number of fishes (bass, gar, pickeral). These fishes tend to have large mouths and long piercing teeth for holding prey. A number of stream fishes feed on the larval stages of fish, but larve are small, vulnerable, and typically available only at certain times of year. Likewise, young stages of true piscivores feed on plankton and invertebrates. </P></BODY>
