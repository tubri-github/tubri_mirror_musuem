<H2>The Alabama River</H2>
</UL></P>
<P><UL>
<LI><H2>The discharge data for the Alabama River came from the gauging station at the Claiborne Lock in Claiborne, AL.
</H2>
<UL>
<LI>This location was chosen because it is the last lock before reaching the mouth of the river and due to the availability of data prior to and after the construction of the Claiborne Lock. 
</UL></UL><UL>
<LI><H2>The Claiborne Lock was constructed in 1969.
</H2>
</UL><UL>
<LI><H2>The average discharge of the Alabama River at Claiborne, AL, is ~34,500 cfs.
</H2>
</UL><UL>
<LI><H2>The five year subsets for the Claiborne site consisted of data from 1964-1968 and 1970-1974, for the pre- and post-construction intervals.
</H2>
</UL><UL>
<LI><H2>The average discharge for the Alabama River pre-construction was ~33,000 cfs.
</H2>
</UL><UL>
<LI><H2>The average discharge prior to the construction of the Claiborne Lock was ~36,000 cfs, which was not a considerably large change in discharge, however it did increase.
</H2>
</UL><UL>
<LI><H2>The discharge data both pre- and post-construction appeared to follow a pattern of higher discharge from December through May and lower discharge between June and November.
</H2>
</UL><UL>
<LI><H2>The discharge data appears to show that the completion of the Claiborne Lock had little impact on the seasonal variation in discharge.
