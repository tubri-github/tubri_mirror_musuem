 <P><UL>
<LI><H2>It appears that the impoundments do not impact the seasonal variation of the discharge on either of the rivers.
</H2>
</UL><UL>
<LI><H2>However, the impoundments do impact the river in that they increase the stage height and reduce the seasonal variation in the river with respect to discharge. 
</H2>
</UL><UL>
<LI><H2>The changes caused by the impoundments may impact the biota by causing increased scouring below the dam and by producing a deeper lentic sytem where it was previously flowing.
</H2>
</UL><UL>
<LI><H2>Above the impoundments sediment will collect and will eventually need to be dredged out, increasing the turbudity of the river, further altering the system.
</H2>
</UL><UL>
<LI><H2>The Mississippi swamps the other rivers when looking at the total tonnage transported up and down the river, but both these river do have a large amount of barge traffic, so the only other alternative would be rail.
