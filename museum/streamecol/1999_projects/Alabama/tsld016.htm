 <H1>The Red River Data</H1> 
 <P><UL>
<LI><H2>The data for the Red River was taken at the John H. Overton Lock in Alexandria, LA.
</H2>
</UL><UL>
<LI><H2>The data was taken from this location due to the fact that it is located in the middle of the series of five navigation locks on the Red River and the availability of data prior to and after the construction of the Overton Lock.
</H2>
</UL><UL>
<LI><H2>The lock was constructed in 1987.
</H2>
</UL><UL>
<LI><H2>The average discharge of the Red River at Alexandria, LA, is ~38,000 cfs.
</H2>
</UL><UL>
<LI><H2>The two five year subsets consisted of data from 1981-1985 and 1988-1989,1992-1994, for the pre- and post-construction intervals.
</H2>
</UL><UL>
<LI><H2>The average discharge for the Red River pre-construction was ~32,000 cfs.
</H2>
</UL><UL>
<LI><H2>The average discharge after the construction of the Overton Lock was ~40,000 cfs, which was considerably higher than the discharge prior to construction of the lock.
</H2>
</UL><UL>
<LI><H2>The discharge data both pre- and post-construction appeared to follow a pattern of higher discharge from November through July and lower discharge between August and October.
</H2>
</UL><UL>
<LI><H2>The stage height increased from ~9 to ~21 feet from the construction of the Overton Lock.
</H2>
</UL><UL>
<LI><H2>The stage height appeared to follow a pattern almost identical to the discharge prior to the construction of the lock, but the stage height shows little to no variability in relation to the discharge after the construction of the lock was </H2>
