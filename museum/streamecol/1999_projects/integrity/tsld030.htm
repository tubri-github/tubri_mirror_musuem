 <H1>Why did IBI and %EPT give different results?</H1> 
 <P><UL>
<LI><H2>There were skewed results because it was easier to find Macroinvertebrates in LA than in AK
</H2>
</UL><UL>
<LI><H2>A large rain event took place after a long period of low flow which may have contributed to low macro populations
</H2>
</UL><UL>
<LI><H2>Some areas of streams were easier to sample from than others (e.g. depth of water, strength of current, etc.)
</H2>
</UL><UL>
<LI><H2>Different people sampling led to slight variations in methods used and what organisms were collected
</H2>
</UL><UL>
<LI><H2>Greater numbers of fish and macros collected at some streams than at others
</H2>
</UL><UL>
<LI><H2>There may not be a direct correlation between IBI and EPT</H2>
