 <H1>Correlations between Forest Cover and IBI</H1> 
 <P><UL>
<LI><H2>With the exception of the Natalbany River, the % Forest Cover correlated with the IBI value calculated; the stream with the greatest amount of forest cover also had the highest IBI value.
</H2>

<LI><H2>A possible reason why the Natalbany River had the highest IBI value but the lowest forest cover is that it is a higher order stream and could have different community characteristics. Mountain Fork is also a 4th order stream, but it appeared to receive a high level of agricultural runoff.  The land use for Natalbany is not known.</H2>
