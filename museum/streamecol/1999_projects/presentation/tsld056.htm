Cyprinella venusta (Blacktail shiner)

<LI> Abundant and widespread

<LI> Collected in the Pearl River samples
</UL><UL>
<LI> The majority of blacktail shiners inhabit swift streams (e.g., the Pearl River)
</UL><UL>
<LI> Spawning strategy: Lay eggs in protective crevices.  Eggs in these areas are vulnerable to slow currents, which could increase sedimentation and reduce oxygen.  This could adversely affect the eggs by increasing development time and decreasing survival.  Therefore, it might be advantageous to position the eggs in a crevice which was adjacent to stronger flows.  Excessively high flows can also be detrimental, so a strong stabilization may be beneficial.
