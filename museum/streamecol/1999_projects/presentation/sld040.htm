Impacts on Stream Macroinvertebrates </UL></P>
<P><UL>
Richness of invertebrate communities is influenced by several factors altered by reservoir construction, such as flow, substrate, and aquatic vegetation.
</UL><UL>
Ward (1976) identified four types of flow regime:
<UL>
<LI> Reduced flow:  low current speed allow fine particles to settle into interstitial areas within the substratum; this can reduce habitat availability for some species.
<LI> Seasonal flow constancy:  bed and bank stability, clarity due to sediment deposition, and more constant currents are generally favorable for vegetation, and consequently, to many benthic invertebrates. 
<LI> Increased flow:  results in scouring of the stream bottom, leading to losses in vegetation and FPOM utilized as food resources. This will reduce or eliminate some benthic species.
<LI> Short-term flow fluctuations:  cause dramatic effects such as stranding of biota during low flows or downstream displacement of benthos. Variable current speeds may destroy pool/riffle sequences and interfere with feeding techniques. </UL></UL></P>
