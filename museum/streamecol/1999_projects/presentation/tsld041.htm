Impacts on Terrestrial Organisms</UL></P>
<P><UL>
Streamside vegetation is an essential resource for many land-dwelling animals, and its destruction can lead to many adverse effects.
</UL><UL>

</UL><UL>
<LI> Many organisms utilize streamside habitats seasonally for shelter, food, and reproductive resources.  Elks give birth in riparian areas, while reptiles and amphibians often lay their eggs near the stream’s edge.
</UL><UL>
<LI> Birds often use the shores for nesting, egg-laying, and roosting.  Reservoirs may lead to destruction of trees, and fluctuating water levels can wash away eggs or destroy nests. 
</UL><UL>
<LI> There is often a correlation between the destruction of these habitats and the decline in animal populations, such as minks, muskrats, beavers, river otters, and nutria. </UL></P>
