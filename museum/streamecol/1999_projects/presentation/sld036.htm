<LI> Data should be collected closer to the vicinity of the dam and compared to a control site.  The Bogalousa site was the only site on the Pearl River with water quality data and was farther south than we would have liked.  This brings in possible effects, such as dampening, due to other streams coming into the Pearl River; although, the Pascagoula collection station was similar in proximity to help account for these effects.</UL></P>
