Impacts on Stream Fishes</UL></P>
<P><UL>
The majority of data and research focuses on the effects dams have on stream fishes.  Populations and community structures may be altered due to migratory obstacles, the effects of stream flow, water quality changes, and temperature fluctuations.

</UL><UL>
<LI> Increased sedimentation can be problematic for stream fishes, blocking the gill filaments of adults and decreasing available oxygen for fish eggs.
</UL><UL>
<LI> Invertebrate depletion results in decreased food availability for insectivorous fish.
</UL><UL>
<LI> Scouring or unusually high flows can remove eggs from the substrate and create obstacles for benthic organisms or fish adapted to slower flows.  
</UL><UL>
<LI> Benefits non-native species by creating new nitches for opportunistic organisms that were unable to live in the former environment.  This can lead to interspecific competition and the possible displacement of native species. </UL></P>
