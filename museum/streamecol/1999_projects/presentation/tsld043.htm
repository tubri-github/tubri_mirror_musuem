Comparison of Fish Species Composition Before and After Construction of the Ross Barnett Reservoir</UL></P>
<P><UL>
In order to gain a better understanding of the specific effects the Ross Barnett Reservoir had on the fish populations in the Pearl River, data from pre- and post-impoundment collections was analyzed.  More extensive data was available for the post-impoundment period; therefore, the initial set was subsampled to get a more balanced comparison.
