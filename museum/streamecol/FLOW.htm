<P ALIGN="CENTER">FLOW MEASUREMENTS AND DYNAMICS</P>
<P>Flowing water is the definitive characteristic of a stream. Everything that a stream ecosystem is happens because water flows. This lecture concerns the measurement and dynamics of flow.</P>
<P>Stream flow, also referred to as <EM>discharge</EM>, is a volumetric measurement. It is the volume of water passing a particular point in a stream over a particular period of time. A stream flows past a particular point at a rate called <I>velocity</I> (distance/time). The volume of water passing a given point along the stream is the velocity times the cross-sectional area, approximated as mean depth times width. The most common unit of flow in English Units is cubic feet per second of <I>cfs </I>(cubic meters per sec or <EM>cumecs</EM> in SI units).</P>
<P>Stream flow is monitored by the Water Resources Division of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). The USGS maintains a large number of stream gaging stations on streams of different sizes in drainge systems across the U.S. The gages record the height or <EM>stage</EM> of the surface of the water relative to a fixed datum (national geodetic datum ~ mean sea level) at 15-minute intervals. By measuring how stream stage or gage height relates to discharge, hydrologists produce a <EM>rating curve,</EM> which they can then use to predict discharge for the various stage measurements.</P>
<P>The USGS has been monitoring stream flow at some stations for long periods of time (50 years or more). Graphs depicting how stream flow varies over time (short or long intervals) are called <I>hydrographs</I>. By studying patterns in hydrographs, hydrologists or stream ecologists can determine the runoff and storage characteristics of different watersheds, or the tendency and frequency of floods and droughts. </P>
<P>The length of time it takes a daily hydrograph to respond to a rainfall event depends of the storage characteristics of the watershed. In general the more porous the soils and the larger and more dense the vegetation cover, the greater the storage capacity and the longer the hydrographic response (contrast a city to a forest). The more storage there is, the longer a stream is charged by groundwater flow. </P>
<EM><P>Flow-duration curves</EM> relate discharge to the percentage of time (typically over the course of a year) that particular discharges are equaled or exceeded. Streams with steeply-sloped curves receive most of their discharge as runoff. Streams with flat curves have high storage. </P>
<P>A <EM>flood-frequency curve </EM>shows the periodicity of floods of different magnitudes (e.g., 100-year flood). Another way of depicting a discharge pattern or variability over time is with a <EM>cumulative-discharge curve</EM>. Changes in the shape of the curve represent changes in discharge patterns.</P>
<P>Discharge is also affected by conditions within the stream itself. Stream velocities are highest just above the <EM>thalweg,</EM> the deepest point along the channel cross section. It is here that there is the least amount of frictional drag (resistence of flow). Resistence to flow is greatest along the streambed and is a function of bed roughness. Hydrologists speak about the <EM>wetted perimeter</EM> of a stream (distance along the bottom from shore to shore of a particular cross section), the <EM>hydraulic radius</EM> (ratio of cross-sectional area to wetted perimeter) and <EM>hydraulic depth</EM> (ratio of cross-sectional area to surface width).</P>
<P>We can also talk about dynamics of flow at different scales (segment, reach, habitat, microhabitat) within a stream. Because of the frictional forces applied by the streambed, the pattern of flow is non-uniform. At the stream-reach scale in alluvial valley segments, regularly recurring floods redistribute bed materials, producing riffles, pools and meanders with amazing predictability. The natural wavelength of flood flows tends to be 6 times channel width, which roughly corresponds to the spacing of pools and riffles. The channel meanders with an average wavelength of 12 bankfull widths, and each full meander tends to have two riffles and two pools.</P>
<P>At the habitat scale, flow dynamics are dictated more by flow momentum and gravitational force, than by boundary friction. In riffles and rapids, flow is divided into non-uniform segments that change from smoothly accelerating (as over or around boulders or other obstacles) to decelerating and turbulent (as in hydraulic jumps and eddy swirls). As flow drops over an obstacle or through a narrow gap it reaches <EM>critical</EM> (maximal) <EM>velocity </EM>for the head of water above the obstruction. The <EM>critical depth</EM> of flow occurs as the water passes over the obstruction and is 2/3 upstream head. The relationship between critical velocity (V<SUB>c</SUB>) and critical depth (d<SUB>c</SUB>) is given by:</P>
<I><FONT SIZE=4><P ALIGN="CENTER">V<SUB>c </SUB>= (gd<SUB>c</SUB>)<SUP>½ </P>
</I></SUP></FONT><P>where g is gravitational acceleration (9.81 m/s).</P>
<P>If the water continues to accelerate past an obstruction, it attains <I>supercritical flow</I>. This brings water into the air and is the whitewater plume seen in a hydraulic jump where the flow rapidly rotates vertically, decelerates, and then climbs to the higher depth of the water downstream. The splashing water and breaking bubbles are the source of noise in a babbling brook and a roaring rapid (uniform flow makes no noise). The state of flow relative to critical velocity is called the <EM>Froude number </EM>and is represented by the equation:</P>
<I><FONT SIZE=4><P ALIGN="CENTER">Fr = V<SUB>m</SUB>/(gd)<SUP>½</P>
</I></SUP></FONT><P>where V<SUB>m </SUB>is mean velocity (m/s) and d is depth of flow (m).   The Froude number has a value of 1 at critical flow; is less than one at subcritical flow and greater than one at supercritical flow.</P>
<P>Critical and near-critical flows are efficient habitats for net-spinning caddisflies and black flies, which trap particulates from the water column. These insects are typically found along the tops of boulders or logs near the critical flows. Fish also take advantage of different zones of flow, moving into calmer eddies below boulders and other obstructions to maintain position less energentically. Salmon are able to jump over obstacles by swimming to the top of hydraulic jumps and propelling against the tumbling water. </P>
<P>Techniques are limited for measuring flow conditions at the microhabitat scale. This is the scale at which near-boundary, laminar flow conditions can be detected. In the laminar boundary layer, water moves in parallel lines without mixing. </P>
<P>We can think of flowing water producing shear stresses on the stream bed as it releases energy as frictional force. The stress is called <EM>tractive force</EM> and depends on the density of water, the height of the water surface (a measure of kinetic energy) and the stream hydraulic radius. The amount of tractive force applied determines substratum stability, size of material transported, and density and composition of benthic community. </P></BODY>
