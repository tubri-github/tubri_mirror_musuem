LeSueur proposed <i>Catostomus</i> as a new genus under order Abdominales and described eighteen new species, including <i>Catostomus cyprinus</i> from the Elk River and streams entering Chesapeake Bay.  LeSueur stated that <i>C. cyprinus</i> was the largest of his <i>Catostomus</i> and  resembled the common carp of Europe.  In <i>Ichthyologia Ohiensis,</i> Constantine Rafinesque (1820) described twelve new <i>Catostomus</i> and subdivided the genus into five subgenera.  Rafinesque defined subgenus <i>Carpiodes</i> as a group characterized by a slighly compressed oblong body, a compressed head, nine abdominal rays, and an elongate, equally-forked tail.  He described <i>Catostomus</i> (<i>Carpiodes</i>) <i>carpio</i> as a large carp sucker with a sloping head, rounded snout, small black eyes, a white chin, bluish abdomen, and olivaceous back.  He described <i>C.</i> (<i>Carpiodes</i>) <i>velifer</i> as having a silvery eliptical body, accented with golden shades, its dorsal fin looking very much like a large sail.  Rafinesque included LeSueur's (1817) <i>Catostomus cyprinus</i> under subgenus <i>Carpiodes.</i> </p><p>In 1854, Louis Agassiz elevated the subgenera of Rafinesque to genera and added five new species of <i>Carpiodes.</i>  The first, <i>Carpiodes urus,</i> from the Tennessee River, was large (20-30 pounds); its body was neither high nor compressed above as in <i>Carpiodes cyprinus</i> (Agassiz 1854: 356).   <i>Carpiodes taurus</i> from the Mobile River, was described as intermediate between <i>C. cyprinus</i> and <i>C. urus</i> in height and compression of the back (Agassiz 1854:355-56).  Agassiz described <i>C. bison</i> from the Osage River, Missouri, as more elongate than <i>C. taurus</i> with a smalled head and opercle (Agassiz 1854:356).  He described <i>C. vitulus</i> from the Wabash River, Indiana, as the smallest of the new forms with a body form like that of <i>C. taurus.</i>   Finally he described <i>C. vacca</i> from the Susquehanna River, a species he felt resembled <i>C. cyprinus</i> more than any other. </p><p>In 1855, Agassiz stated that the family of  cyprinoids to which <i>Carpiodes</i> and <i>Ictiobus</i> belong, posed a unique problem when attempting to recognize genera, because of the necessity of dissecting specimens in order to identify key features. As a solution he proposed analysis of pharyngeal teeth as a reliable characteriztic for separating genera.  In performing this analysis, Agassiz discovered that <i>Carpiodes</i> comprised two distinct groups: those with thin flat pharyngeals with extremely small teeth, and generally possessing high dorsal fins (these he retained in <i>Carpiodes</i>); and those with triangular pharyngeal teeth that gradually increased in size and thickness along the upper margin of the bone, and generally possessing low dorsal fins (these he classified in the new genus <i>Bubalichthys</i>).  In this latter group he put <i>C. urus,</i> <i>C. taurus,</i> <i>C. vitulus.</i>  Agassiz (1855) further claimed that <i>C. cyprinus</i> comprised three different species: nominal <i>C. cyprinus</i> LeSueur from streams of the middle Atlantic Slope (<i>C. vacca</i> was relegated to its synonymy); <i>C. cyprinus</i> of the Ohio River, which Agassiz believed to be <i>Carpiodes velifer</i> Rafinesque; and a species collected by Zadik Thompson from Lake Champlain and considered native to the  "waters of Northern States," which Agassiz (1854) mistakenly called <i>C. cyprinus.</i>  He named this later form <i>C. thompsoni</i> (Agassiz 1855: 76) and stated that it was easily differentiated from <i>C. velifer</i> by its smaller, more open angled scales.  He considered <i>C. thompsoni</i> and <i>C. velifer</i> to be the shortest bodied <i>C. cyprinus</i>-like forms, <i>C. bison</i> to be the longest, and <i>C. cyprinus</i> intermediate.     </p> <p>Spencer Baird and Charles Girard (1854) described <i>C. tumidus</i> from the Rio Grande near Fort Brown, Texas.  In 1857, Girard described <i>Carpiodes damalis</i> as a carp sucker from the upper Missouri with large scales, small pectorals, and a dorsal fin that was much longer than high anteriorly.</p><p>Five more species of <i>Carpiodes</i> were added by Edward Drinker Cope in 1870.  He described <i>C. difformis</i> from the Wabash River in Indiana, as a medium sized, brownish golden carp sucker having a large eye and a hidden premaxillary bone.  The premaxillary was more visible in <i>C. cutisanserinus</i> from the Kiskiminitis River of western Pennsylvania, whose body was the same size as <i>C. difformis</i> but silvery in color.  He considered <i>C. selene</i> from the Root River in Michigan, to be intermediate between these two, but with a distinguishable premaxillary bone, a longer muzzle, and its orbit as large as in <i>C. difformis.</i>  Cope described <i>C. grayi</i> as a form probably from the western states, with dorsal radii not so long as in <i>C. thompsoni.</i>  He described <i>C. nummifer</i> as the largest species in the genus (up to 24 inches), distinguishable by its "exaggerated elongation, the small proportion of its head, and the oliver silver to nickle color of its body" (hence the epithet nummifer which means "money bearer," Cope 1870).    </p><p>Cope (1870) also divided the genus into two groups based on the form of the dorsal fin and the shape of the muzzle.  The first group had highly elevated anterior dorsal rays equalling or exceeding the dorsal base, and a very obtuse muzzle.  The second group had shorter dorsals extending to little over half the base length of the fin, and a conic and projecting muzzle.  Cope included <i>C. difformis,</i> <i>C. cutisanserinus,</i> and <i>C. selene</i> in the first group, and <i>C. grayi</i> and <i>C. nummifer</i> in the second group.</p><p>In <i>Fishes of North and Middle America,</i> Jordan and Evermann (1896) reduced the number of species in <i>Carpiodes</i> by over half. <i>Carpiodes nummifer</i> Cope and <i>C. bison</i> Agassiz were relegated to synonymy of <i>C. carpio</i> Rafinesque. <i>Carpiodes cutisanserinus</i> Cope was relegated to the synonmy of <i>C. difformis</i> Cope.  <i>Carpiodes selene</i> was treated as a junior synonym of  <i>C. thompsoni</i> Agassiz.  <i>Carpiodes velifer</i> Rafinesque - which was known by common names such as quillback, spearfish, and sailfish - was determined by Jordan and Evermann to encompass <i>C. grayi</i> Cope, <i>C. damalis</i> Girard and <i>C. tumidus</i> Baird and Girard.  Finally, <i>C. vacca</i> Agassiz was assigned to the synonymy of <i>C. cyprinus</i> (LeSueur).  Meek (1904) described <i>Carpiodes microstomus</i> from the Rio Conchos and <i>C. elongatus</i> form the Rio Camacho of Mexico.</p><p>Hubbs (1930), restating recommendations he first made in papers appearing the preceding year (Hubbs and Brown 1929, Hubbs and Ortenburger 1929a and b), transfered <i>C. difformis</i> Cope to the synonymy of <i>C. velifer</i> Rafinesque, which he removed from the synonymy of <i>C. cyrpinus</i> LeSueur.  <i>C. thompsoni</i> Agassiz was determined by Hubbs to be a synonym of <i>C. cyprinus.</i> He distinguished the large-bodied, elongate form from the Illinois River - which Forbes and Richardson (1908) referred to as  <i>C. thompsoni</i> - and renamed it <i>C. forbesi.</i> However, Hubbs (1930: 13) cast doubt on the validity of <i>C. forbesi,</i> stating that it may be a hybrid between <i>C. cyprinus</i> and <i>C. carpio</i> and that he named it for "convenience and emphasis".</p><p>Hubbs and Black (1940) studied variation in <i>C. carpio</i> across the range and subdivided the species into western and central (Mississippi Basin) subspecies.  They relegated <i>C. elongatus</i> Meek and <i>C. microstomus</i> Meek to the synonymy of <i>C. carpio</i> Rafinesque, retaining <i>C. c. elongatus</i> as a western subspecies of  <i>C. carpio</i> (distinguished on the basis of its elongate body form and the weakly developed semitubercular process on tip of the lower jaw) and treating <i>C. microstomus</i> as a junior synonym of <i>C. elongatus.</i></p><p>Milton Trautman (1956) proposed the name <i>C. cyprinus hinei</i> to distinguish the more elongate quillback in the Ohio River Valley, from the deeper bodied form found in Lake Erie (<i>C. c. cyprinus</i>).  However, Trautman recognized considerable variation in body form within <i>C. c. cyprinus,</i> which he attributed to differences in water quality.  He suggested that an ecomorphic effect might explain the differences in body form he noted between lake and river inhabiting "subspecies" of  <i>C. cyprinus.</i>  Bailey and Allum (1962) citing Hubb's doubts and Trautman's suggestion shape variation in some Ohio <i>C. cyprinus</i> was ecophenotypic, relegated <i>C. forbesi</i> to the synonymy of <i>C. cyprinus.</i> </p>      <P></P>			<p align=right>			<A href="intro.html">Prev</a> | <A href="ictiobus.html">Next</a></p>		</td>		<td width=100 align=right bgcolor="#99cc99">			<center>			<IMG alt="tree picture" border=0 height=77  src="images/tree.gif" width =44>			</center>			<font face=arial,geneva>			<p>			<A href="default.html">Summary</a>			</p>			<p>			<A href="intro.html">Introduction</a>			</p>			<p>			<A href="carpiodes.html">Carpiodes</a>			</p>			<p>			<A href="ictiobus.html">Ictiobus</a>			</p>			<p>			<A href="distribution.html">Distribution</a>			</p>			<p>			<A href="field.html">Field Work</a>			<p>			<A href="extmorph.html">External Morphology</a>			</p>			<p>			<A href="typeloc.html">Types &amp; Their Location</a>			</p>			<p>			<A href="morphometrics.html">Morphometrics</a>			</p>			<p>			<A href="allozymes.html">Allozymes &amp; Isozymes</a>			</p>			<p>			<A href="file://G:\ictiobin\DNA.html" >Molecular Sequencing</a>			</p>			<p>			<A href="litcited.html">Literature Cited</a>			</p>			<p>			<A href="pubpres.html">Publications &amp; Presentations</a>			</p>			<p>			<a href="http://www.tubri.org/museum/museum/reshank.html">Hank Bart's Research</a>			</p>			<p>			<a href="http://www.tubri.org/museum/museum/museum.html">Tulane Museum of Natural History</a>			</p>			</font>		</td>	</tr></table><p><IMG src="counter.count$tulane/ictiobin"></p></body></html><!--#fatPage#version 1#docs http://www.scripting.com/fatPages/faq.html#adrObject user.websites.ictiobin.carpiodes#netAddress 129.81.102.17#objectCreated 1/8/98; 3:01:54 PM#objectModified 1/19/99; 12:35:10 PM#lastBuildTime 2/25/99; 4:27:01 PM-->
